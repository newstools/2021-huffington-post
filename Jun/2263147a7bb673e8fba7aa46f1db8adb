Are you a brioche stan, or do you adore a humble bap? That’s the debate kicking off on Twitter after one user, named Jennifer, let rip at burgers served in brioche buns. Jennifer asked restauranteurs to stop selling brioche buns on the basis that “nobody likes them.” Jennifer, is has been pointed out, is wrong. Very wrong.  restaurateurs.... Please, please STOP selling us burgers in brioche buns. STOP. Nobody likes them. I mean nobody. I've never met anyone who said, "oh I love a good brioche" 🤨Just give us a good roll/bap/barm whatever your region calls it 🤦🏻‍♀️ Hundreds of people have weighed in to give their backing to brioche buns, sharing tips, pictures and even recipes to convert the naysayers. Eh…. I quite like a wee brioche bun Restaurants do not listen we love a brioche bun! "Oh I love a good brioche!"Nothing worse than those tasteless bugger buns of pappy white bread, yuk. I love brioche buns, I have them at home lightly toasted with lots of butter, crispy bacon and ketchup. 😋 I used to hate them, but load them up with salty beef and bacon, cheese  and other fried wholesome goodness, squash ‘em tight and they ain’t so bad…forgive the 80’s plate and bite marks, I wasn’t expecting this to go public 😩 pic.twitter.com/6GJqkLxZKk But Jennifer’s tweet has gained more than 4,500 likes from the other side, with plenty of people agreeing with her that the buns have to go.  Whatever happened to good old fashioned crusty buns with sesame seeds on top?Or crunchy baguettes?Especially banh mi.Save the brioche for dessert.With raisins & cinnamon There has never been a burger that was improved by a brioche bun, ever, nor will there ever be one.I find the increases in sugar in everything to be increasingly unpalatable, not to mention worrying. Here we go again, the replies, divided Britain. For my tastebuds brioche belongs in a dessert (lemon brioche, brioche & butter pudding, lashings of custard); burgers should be savoury (think relish, lettuce, cheese, gherkins), I don’t want the bun to be the main attraction. Brioche is cake, not bread.You may as well serve a burger in a Victoria Sponge (please don’t Hoxton). Agreed. Brioche burgers are like putting pineapple on pizza, which is also an abomination. I will entertain no further debate on this matter. https://t.co/427OalfZd3 And while we’re hear, some people are coming after rocket, too.  Its like lettuce in salads,  its always that fuckin rocket crap that a horse would have trouble chewing. Gold old iceberg lettuce not fashionable enough for the catering industry. Brioche buns are the job. Though there are real crimes in the burger world. 1. Rocket, lettuce should be for badly needed crunch only. 2. Bracing, a shoving a stick through a burger. If it's going to fall apart on the way to the table then it's too big to each comfortably. It’s not the first time the great brioche debate has hit social media and it probably won’t be the last. Restauranteurs, if you’re reading this, maybe just give people a choice?
