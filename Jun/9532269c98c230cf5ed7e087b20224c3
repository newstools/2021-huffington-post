We hope you love the products we recommend! All of them were independently selected by our editors. Just so you know, HuffPost UK may collect a share of sales or other compensation from the links on this page if you decide to shop from them. Oh, and FYI — prices are accurate and items in stock as of time of publication. The annual Prime Day extravaganza activates thousands of price cuts across home and garden, tech, beauty, fashion, groceries, pet-care – even booze. Chances are you’re on the hunt for some discounted treats you’ve had on your wish-list for a while. But remember, it’s also a great time to stock up on mega boring purchases at a fraction of the price. If you don’t bulk buy dishwasher tablets and Post-It notes now, you’re missing a trick. And the best bit about bagging a deal on an everyday item that’s boring but essential? Knowing you’ve saved money to spend on something special. Here are some of our favourite discounted fillers (if not exactly thrillers) that we’ve found – you can thank us later. To take advantage of Prime Day deals, you’ll need an Amazon Prime membership.
