The much-hyped GB News finally launched on Sunday night, positioned as a rival to the news and current affairs offerings from the likes of the BBC and Sky. GB News chairman and presenter Andrew Neil hosted the launch with a promise to “expose the growing promotion of cancel culture” and give a voice “to those who feel sidelined or silenced”. “We are proud to be British,” Andrew told viewers. “The clue is in the name.” GB News is available to watch now on Sky channel 515, Virgin Media channel 626, Freeview and YouView channel 236, Freesat channel 216, as well as online.
