Cheryl Of-No-Current-Surname has made a rare appearance on social media, more than a year since her last update. The former Girls Aloud star shared two snaps of herself on Instagram on Tuesday to tease a forthcoming project. Well, we say “tease”, but nobody actually seems to know anything about her return to the spotlight – and Cheryl isn’t exactly giving anything away either. She captioned the pics: “We back”. That said, Cheryl sharing brand new pics – including one of herself and one with her glam squad – is an event in itself these days. Lovely. Cheryl last posted something on Instagram in June last year. She’s taken a step back from the limelight in recent years to care for her four-year-old son, Bear, her child with former One Direction star, Liam Payne. Last year the Cheryl revealed she was on the look out for a sperm donor in a bid to have more children. The 37-year-old says she does not want Bear to be her only child, and intends to conceive “more than one” baby via a sperm donor. The singer told The Times magazine the forthcoming treatment “makes me very happy”. She said: “If time was on my side and I was in my twenties, yeah, I would wait and consider more options, or wait for somebody I felt was right, but… “You could meet somebody and for that year it feels incredible, but there is never a guarantee because there are so many variables that can happen. Life is a funny old game.”
