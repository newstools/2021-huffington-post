We hope you love the products we recommend! All of them were independently selected by our editors. Just so you know, HuffPost UK may collect a share of sales or other compensation from the links on this page if you decide to shop from them. Oh, and FYI — prices are accurate and items in stock as of time of publication. Amazon Prime Day is actually a 48-hour extravaganza, meaning you still have until the end of Tuesday, June 22 to bag a bargain across home, garden, tech, fashion, beauty and more.  But don’t leave it too long. There are plenty of discounts and discoveries to be made but some of the amazing deals only last as long as stocks do. So if you’re interested to know what other busy shoppers have been bagging, we’ve rounded up the best-sellers among our HuffPost and BuzzFeed readers. To take advantage of Prime Day deals, you’ll need an Amazon Prime membership. Sign up for a free 30-DAY trial today if you’re not already a member.
