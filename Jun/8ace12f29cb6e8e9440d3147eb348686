The actor later moved into film and appeared in features by Tim Burton and James Bond director Cary Fukunaga. In 2011, he played Briggs in Cary Fukunaga’s Jane Eyre and in 2014 played Jean in A Little Chaos, directed by Alan Rickman. He also appeared in Miss Peregrine’s Home For Peculiar Children, directed by Tim Burton, in 2016. Ben’s other credits included the crime drama The Professionals, the kids’ TV series The Queen’s Nose, as well as a minor role in Doctor Who in 1984. His former The Bill co-star Ben Peyton was among those who paid tribute, describing him as a “legend”.  So sad to hear about the brilliant Ben Roberts. Superb actor and an absolutely hilarious man. We were both axed from The Bill on the same day back in 2001. He came to my dressing room and said, “They made a mistake with our names. You were supposed to be sacked twice!” 😆#legendpic.twitter.com/BMnVdl3T0T He tweeted: “So sad to hear about the brilliant Ben Roberts.
