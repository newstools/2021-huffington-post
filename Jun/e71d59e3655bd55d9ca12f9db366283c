Washington state has approved retailers offering “joints for jabs,” enabling them to give out free marijuana to encourage people to get their Covid-19 vaccine.  In an announcement from the state’s liquor and cannabis board, state-licensed cannabis retailers were permitted to offer customers who are at least 21 years old one pre-rolled joint when they get vaccinated at an in-store vaccination clinic. The temporary allowance will go through July 12.  Washington is the latest of several states to get creative in motivating its residents to get vaccinated: California is doing a vaccine lottery, including giving away $1.5 million to 10 vaccinated residents, and New Jersey is backing breweries offering free beer to those who are vaccinated, among other initiatives.   Over half the US population has now had at least one Covid vaccine so far.  Since last year, more than 597,000 people in the US have died from the coronavirus. On average, there are still over 14,000 cases reported daily nationwide, and over 300 people dying each day.
