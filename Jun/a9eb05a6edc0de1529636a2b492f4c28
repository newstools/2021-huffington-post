England’s Covid R rate has remained between 1.2 and 1.4, scientists advising the government have said. Official figures published on Friday showed no change on last week’s R. But because the figure is over 1, it still means the epidemic is growing in England, after Boris Johnson delayed the final lifting of Covid restrictions from June 21 to July 19. If R is greater than 1 the epidemic is generally seen to be growing; if R is less than 1 the epidemic is shrinking. If R is at 1, the epidemic is staying at the same size. An R of between 1.2 and 1.4 means every ten people with Covid will infect between 12 and 14 other people. In England, the R rate is between 1.2 and 1.4 (no change) East of England – 1.1 to 1.3 (down from 1.1 to 1.4) London – 1.1 to 1.4 (no change) Midlands – 1.0 to 1.3 (down from 1.1 to 1.3)  North-east and Yorkshire – 1.0 to 1.3 (up from 1.0 to 1.2)   North-west – 1.3 to 1.5 (no change) South-east – 1.0 to 1.3 (down from 1.1 to 1.4) South west –  1.0 to 1.5 (up from 1.0 to 1.3) The estimates are provided by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) and the Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC). Sage and DHSC said “particular care should be taken” when interpreting the regional estimates in England.
