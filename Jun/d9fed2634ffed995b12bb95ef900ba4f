The Delta variant, which first originated in India, is now the most dominant variant in the UK, according to Public Health England (PHE), with 12,431 recorded cases. England has the most confirmed cases by far (10,797), followed by Scotland (1,511), Wales (97) and Northern Ireland (26 cases). The number of people testing positive for this particular variant have risen on a weekly basis, with scientists suggesting this new variant is more transmissible than the Alpha variant, which originated in Kent. Early evidence also suggests there may be an increased risk of hospitalisation, although more data is needed to confirm this.  Bolton remains one of the most affected areas, where cases have risen by 795 to 2,149 in the space of a week, while Blackburn with Darwen has also seen 368 new cases, bringing it to 724 in total.
