Mariah Carey recently cast doubt on her past attempt at “The Rachel” — the popular 1990s hairstyle made famous by Jennifer Aniston — but the Friends actor herself celebrated the look.  Over the weekend, the five-time Grammy-winning singer posted a throwback photo of herself in a black and white dress holding a microphone. Mariah commented on her hairstyle in the picture, writing with a laughing-face emoji in the caption that it was her “sad attempt at the Rachel hairdo.” But Jennifer didn’t think the look was sad at all.  “LOVE IT,” the Friends star replied. Mariah’s look also garnered support from other commenters, including a co-sign from Kerry Washington, who wrote: “Nailed it!!!!!” Jennifer memorably debuted the hairdo on Friends as her character Rachel Green. The look, created by hairstylist Chris McMillan, became popular even though Jen has since admitted she had a hard time maintaining the ’do herself.  Fans of the TV sitcom have recently had the opportunity to marvel at Rachel Green’s signature look when the cast came back together for a Friends reunion that premiered last week.
