We could probably all do with a big sleep to recuperate, but nodding off isn’t always so easy.  Multiple studies from around the world have linked the Covid-19 pandemic to poor sleep, nightmares and difficulty nodding off. Unsurprisingly, stress and anxiety are largely to blame for keeping us up at night, but it doesn’t help that bedtime routines were thrown off for months for children and adults alike.  With the UK looking towards the final stage of lockdown, though, it’s time to get back on track. Refreshing yourself on the principles of good “sleep hygiene” is a good place to start, with habits like reducing screen time before bed, sticking to a regular bedtime and avoiding stimulating food and drink.  Once you’ve nailed the basics, there’s a range of products you can buy to help create a restful environment at home and get you in the mood to snooze.
