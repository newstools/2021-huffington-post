Graham Norton might have had a year off from Eurovision duties after last year’s event was cancelled, but he certainly had not lost his touch as the Song Contest returned on Saturday night.  The chat show host was on fine comedic form as he commentated on the evening’s proceedings.  Graham delivered plenty of his trademark barbs and zingers as 26 delegates from across Europe took to the stage at Rotterdam’s Ahoy arena. Here are some of his best one liners... Proving why he’d be a brilliant X Factor judge... On the Serbian trio Hurricane... On Germany’s, errrrrm, unique offering... Commenting on Albanian entrant Anxhela’s smoky staging... On Finland’s heavy metal rockers Blind Channel... On Lithuanian band The Roop... On the Italian entry (which went on to win)... On Israeli singer Eden Alene attempting the highest ever note ever at Eurovision... On San Marino... On Flo Rida joining San Marino’s Senhit on stage... Eurovision is available to catch up with on BBC iPlayer.
