If you take a look at the most-liked recipes on the HuffPost Taste Instagram account in April, it seems our followers are craving two things: sweets and meats. With the exception of two recipes, the creations on this month’s list are either desserts or animal-based protein. On the sweet side of things there’s a blueberry oat cake, lavender Earl Grey cookies and key lime bars. If you’re looking to up your protein, there’s crispy baked chicken wings, a Japanese katsu sando, butter steak and Greek meatballs.
