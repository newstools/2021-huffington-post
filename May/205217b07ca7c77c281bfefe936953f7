A black cat had the luckiest moment of her nine lives this week when she leaped from the fifth floor of a burning building in Chicago. The kitty jumped with a meow, literally landed on her feet and then, after a little hop, scurried off: The Chicago Fire Department told Fox 32 that the cat indeed survived.  “It went under my car and hid until she felt better after a couple of minutes and came out and tried to scale the wall to get back in,” spokesperson Larry Langford told the Chicago Sun-Times. He also said they were still searching for the owner of the unit and, presumably, the cat.  WGN said the fire was contained to a single unit and quickly extinguished. No injuries were reported.
