Sometime in the future, Ariana Grande may wax nostalgic about today. That’s because Madame Tussauds has unveiled a wax figure of the singer at its museum on Hollywood Boulevard. The wax version of Ariana is posed in a set inspired by her 7 Rings music video and wears a black lace two-piece with an oversize white feather jacket draping off her shoulders and glittery platform heels. And it is seriously lifelike... Nailed it. The life-size figure is in the museum’s “A-List” room next to wax renditions of Jimmy Kimmel and singer Jason Derulo ― neither of whom can hold a candle to her (it’s wax, she’ll melt ― get it?). There’s no word on whether the wax tribute has melted Grande’s heart. HuffPost reached out to the singer for comment but she did not immediately respond.
