It’s been an unusual awards season that has seen many ceremonies pivot to virtual or go ahead with Covid protocols, but Tuesday night saw the stage set for a much more familiar Brit Awards.  British music’s biggest night went ahead with relative normalcy as part of the government’s live event research programme, meaning there was an audience, live performances and plenty of stars in attendance thanks to strict Covid testing.  Prior to the ceremony, some of the biggest names in music and other celebrity guests walked the red carpet outside The O2 Arena in London to help mark the return of live music. They included plenty of nominees and performers such as Dua Lipa, Little Mix, Arlo Parks, Coldplay, Olivia Rodrigo, Celeste, Olly Alexander, and Griff, as well as presenters like awards host Jack Whitehall, Clara Amfo, Maya Jama, and Billy Porter. Take a look at all the red carpet looks from this year’s Brit Awards in the gallery below...
