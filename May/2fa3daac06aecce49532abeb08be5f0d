England’s Covid R rate has risen slightly, scientists advising the government have said. Official figures published on Friday suggest the nationwide R rate is between 0.9 and 1.1. Last week it was between 0.8 and 1.1. R measures the number of people, on average, that each sick person will infect. If R is greater than 1 the epidemic is generally seen to be growing; if R is less than 1 the epidemic is shrinking. In England, the R rate is between 0.9 and 1.1 (up from 0.8 and 1.1)  East of England – 0.8 to 1.1 (unchanged) London – 0.9 to 1.1 (up from 0.8 to 1.0)  Midlands – 0.8 to 1.0 (unchanged)  North-east and Yorkshire – 0.8 to 1.0 (unchanged)  North-west – 0.9 to 1.2 (up from 0.8 to 1.1)  South-east – 0.8 to 1.0 (unchanged) South west – 0.8 to 1.1 (unchanged)  The estimates are provided by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) and the Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC). Sage and DHSC said “particular care should be taken” when interpreting the regional estimates in England. In Scotland the latest figures estimate the R rate is between 0.9 and 1.2, up from 0.7 and 1.0. In Wales it is estimated to be between 0.7 and 1.0, unchanged from last week. And in Northern Ireland, the latest figures suggest R is between 0.8 and 1.10, unchanged from last week. Previously a UK-wide figure for R was published, but this has now been been dropped.
