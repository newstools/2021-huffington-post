Naomi Campbell has announced she’s become a mother to a baby girl. The supermodel revealed the news in an Instagram photo, showing herself cradling the newborn’s feet in her hands. She wrote: “A beautiful little blessing has chosen me to be her mother. So honoured to have this gentle soul in my life there are no words to describe the lifelong bond that I now share with you my angel.” Naomi – who will be celebrating her 51st birthday later this week – added: “There is no greater love.” Naomi offered no other information on the new arrival but did tag her own mother, Valerie Morris-Campbell, in the post. HuffPost UK has contacted Naomi Campbell’s representatives for more information. The baby is Naomi’s first, with the legendary model having shared her hopes to have a family on numerous occasions in the past. In 2018, she told Vogue magazine: “I’d love to have kids. I don’t discount anything in life. I love kids and always will. “When I’m around children, I become a child myself. That’s the little girl I don’t ever want to lose.” A year earlier, she told ES magazine that she thinks about starting a family “all the time”, adding: “Now with the way science is I think I can do it when I want.” During this interview, Naomi also said she would want to be in a relationship before having a child. Asked about her thoughts on having a child by the Wall Street Journal in 2019, Naomi insisted: “Not yet – I’ll see what the universe brings me. For now, what the universe has delivered is very much in the spirit of a ‘chosen family’.”
