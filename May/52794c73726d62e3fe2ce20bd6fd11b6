There’s been much ado about the differences between Generation Y (aka millennials) and Generation Z. But considerably less attention is paid to the folks who were born before them ― the oft-forgotten Generation X. And Gen Xers might be just fine with that. At least many of the funny ones on Twitter seem to be. We’ve rounded up 45 hilarious and relatable tweets about Gen X. Enjoy! My daughter keeps saying “ok boomer” and I keep trying to tell her I’m Gen X and that little saying means nada to me. GEN X: lol Boomers and Millennials and their generation warsNEWS: *mentions Gen X one time*GEN X: first of all *forty tweet thread* It is our time to shine!! 🤣🤣 #GenX pic.twitter.com/cBAFWehPsT omg hot metal slides. Society didn’t want Gen X to make it out of high school. I’m sure of it. Hot metal slides. Concrete playgrounds. The whole concept of latch key kids. 😂😂 https://t.co/bBpezFQO48 Gen X watching Millenials fighting with Gen ZQuietly bets all money on Gen Z I'm not going to look up why "Gen X" is trending I'll just assume it's because we died Just saw a 20-something girl wearing a Nirvana t-shirt but with a picture of Hanson on it. A++ Gen X trolling. I love how Gen X is acting all tough now. It's like, our moms didn't supervise us while we watched Duran Duran videos. Real Mad Max stuff. I’m just a GenXer, standing in front of history, asking it to acknowledge me. https://t.co/qYexFrdrOm I was born on the exact cusp of Generation X and Millennials so I have really shitty fashion sense, but I'm unapologetic about it. Generation X's retirement plan is a dollar bill with some Pixies lyrics scribbled on it stuck to a vision board. Everyone: "Let's reopen everything now!"Gen X: Opens front door, looks around at everyone, shakes head, closes and locks door. I’m Gen X and all I care about is when I can wear tiny backpacks again The one saving grace of Generation X is that we shut up about our generation early on, and so did everyone else. Like we all read that Douglas Coupland book and said, "Let us never speak of this again."
