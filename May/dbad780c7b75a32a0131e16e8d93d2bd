In April, the experts at Nameberry revealed that Luna, Arlo, Ava and Milo were among the most popular baby names on the site for the first quarter of 2021.  A follow-up report from the site, which maintains a database of baby names and provides naming resources for expectant parents, highlights the most viewed names among its users around the world. It identified the five most visited name pages for girls and boys over the past year among visitors from 25 countries, including South Africa, Pakistan, Brazil, Finland and Germany. Needless to say, there are a lot of interesting overlaps and divergences. And while some names are genuinely common picks of the moment in those countries, others reflect pop culture hits (a la Lilibet in Russia, where “The Crown” is reportedly popular). While these names aren’t necessarily the most popular in each country, given that they’re based on user data from one website, they do offer a window into what names are trending or may become more popular in the future. Below, find the top baby names of 2021 among Nameberry visitors from 25 countries.
