The rules parents set for their children are often informed by scholarly research, past family experience, and individual personality considerations. Other times, however, they’re based on completely random whims or bizarre circumstances.  The funny parents and children of Twitter have joked about and lamented these funny and arbitrary rules. We’ve rounded up 18 relatable examples.  Most rules parents make are totally arbitrary. "We don't eat ice cream for breakfast." Why not? Mostly because I don't want to share it. anyone else's parents have arbitrary rules about what food in the fridge is for eating, and what's for saving? no? just mine, then. No more French fries until you eat a chicken nugget is my personal favourite Me: “Kids, there will be no Covid schooling tomorrow in observance of Mother’s Day.”Husband: “But Mother’s Day is today, not tomorrow.”Me: “My school, my rules. Also, you’re fired.” Are anyone else's parents so inconsistent with the strict rules that you get whiplash cuz same “We don’t eat candy we find in the public restroom” is a rule I had to make for 3 today. I had my oldest son convinced for years that I didn’t have any control over the rules.  When he’d question something, I’d shrug and say, “Well, that’s the rule.”  He was about 7 when he caught on. As a parent I enjoy making up arbitrary rules about things like breakfast.“No you can’t have macaroni n cheese for breakfast. Here, have some chocolate Coco Puffs and a side of chocolate milk instead. Much better.” haha whats the deal with parents putting arbitrary rules on their kids for literally no reason?!"You can bring water in your room but not soda!" Tf is that!!! I need to enforce a new rule here.  No random children talking of Iron Man and roller coasters until I've had at least a sip of coffee
