Jeremy Vine has joined in the fun after a clip of the BBC broadcaster appearing to go full Alan Partridge was shared widely on Twitter. On his BBC Radio 2 show on Thursday, Vine threw out some possible solutions to the abattoir labour shortage that means hundreds of pigs across the UK face being slaughtered. The journalist had received a message from an east Yorkshire farm where – he explained – they faced a dilemma about what do do with their pigs as the animals could not enter the food chain as normal. He continued: “Is there anything else we can do here? Could people adopt them as pets? Could people collect pigs and slaughter them personally ... use them as a spit roast or something. I don’t know, they’re obviously very different choices there.” The clip was seized on by the Accidental Partridge account, which shares Partridge-esque moments seen in the wild.
