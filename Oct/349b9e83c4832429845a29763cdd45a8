Oh, and FYI — prices are accurate and items in stock as of time of publication. Christmas is around the corner which means it’s time to start present buying. The pandemic meant many of us couldn’t spend the festive season with our families and friends in 2020, but this year we hope to exchange gifts in person, so you’ll want to make sure yours is something special. Beauty gifts are a brilliant option – and no, we don’t mean a naff multi-pack that goes to the back of your cupboard and never get used. The best beauty gifts are the ones that feel luxe, even if they don’t cost a bomb. They’re a treat to open and, picked right, are the gift that keeps on giving well into 2022. We know Christmas shopping can be overwhelming but our gift guides are here to help you. From cult skincare to lush haircare, gorgeous makeup sets to nifty nail sets, these beauty goodies are sure to wow your friends and family – in fact you might even end up getting a few bits for yourself!
