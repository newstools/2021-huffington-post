It’s that time of year again! And no, we’re not talking about Halloween. There’s a new season of The Great British Bake Off airing Stateside. The reality baking competition – also known as “The Great British Baking Show” in the US – began airing its 12th season in late September. Since then, viewers have been tuning in each week to watch another crop of delightful amateur bakers vie for the title of star baker. For American audiences, the show offers a hilarious introduction to obscure British desserts, and it’s refreshing to watch a reality competition show where the contestants are actually nice to each other and seem genuinely happy (or “chuffed,” as they say) to be there. That’s the word on Twitter, anyway. We’ve rounded up 35 funny “GBBO” tweets from US viewers – and one for luck, from the show’s co-presenter Matt Lucas, to get you through this season. After watching The Great British Baking Show for many years, I still don’t have a firm handle on what the Brits mean when they say pudding. I get all snooty about Great British Bake Off contestants doing things wrong like two years ago I wasn't googling "what is shoe pastry" Me: I’m fineAlso me: [visibly crying when the contestants of Bake Off help each other] Me normally: I suck at cooking lolMe watching the Great British Bake Off: rookie mistake not beating in the egg whites right away that’s gonna come back to bite you after the prove Great Asian Bake Off is the same but the contestants make the judges eat their whole dish not just one bite bc wow you are looking thin so eat up you must eat ALL THIS FOOD WE MADE IT FOR YOU WE LOVE YOU me: challahbritish bake-off: "enriched dough plaited loaf" I’ve been working for british people for five years but I feel like I didn’t really understand them until I started watching bake off.
