Police officers had to protect Cabinet minister Michael Gove as he was surrounded by a group of anti-vaxxers during protests in Westminster. The communities secretary was approached by a number of people with video cameras as he walked through central London. Footage shared on social media showed the senior minister quickly being encircled by police officers, who moved the protesters back. The incident on Tuesday happened in the aftermath of the fatal stabbing of Southend West MP Sir David Amess, which has raised concerns over the safety of MPs. The Metropolitan Police tweeted: “We’re aware of a protest in Westminster today which is marching to a number of locations. “During this protest, a group attempted to surround a Member of Parliament on Horseferry Road. “Our officers were immediately on scene where they safely escorted him to a nearby building.” Gove, who was carrying a bag, a file and a drink at the time, was asked by an officer where he was going. He pointed down the street and officers then put themselves between the MP and protesters as they helped him to make his way into a nearby building. Amid jostling as officers attempted to keep demonstrators back from the entrance, a man appeared to shout “Arrest Michael Gove”. One person who approached Gove asked him how he justified “illegal lockdowns”. The Met said there have been no arrests following the incident, but that they will review footage circulating online as well as officers’ body-worn video “to see if any offences occurred”. London Mayor Sadiq Khan condemned the treatment of Gove and thanked police for stepping in. “This is just wrong,” Khan said. “Politicians should be able to go out without being intimidated or fearing for their safety.”
