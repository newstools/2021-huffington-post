Strictly Come Dancing bosses have released the full list of songs and dances fans can expect to see on this Saturday’s live show.  The 11 remaining couples will be taking to the floor in the hope of securing a place in next week’s Halloween Special.  Ugo Monye and Oti Mabuse will be returning to the competition after the former rugby player was forced to sit out last week’s show due to an injury, and together they will be taking on a Rumba to Leave The Door Open by Bruno Mars, and Anderson .Paak, aka Silk Sonic.  Other artists whose songs will feature in week five include Stevie Nicks, Harry Styles (as well as his former band One Direction) and George Michael.  Take a look at the full list below... Sunday’s results show saw Greg Wise and Karen Hauer wave goodbye to the competition after landing in the dreaded dance-off alongside Judi Love and Graziano Di Prima.  Days earlier, Robert Webb and Dianne Buswell were also forced to withdraw from the BBC show due to the Peep Show star’s ongoing health issues. Strictly Come Dancing continues on Saturday at 7.05pm on BBC One.
