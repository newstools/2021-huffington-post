The New York Daily News slammed Donald Trump Jr. as the “SPAWN OF HATIN’” on its front page Tuesday. The tabloid ripped into ex-President Donald Trump’s eldest son for peddling shirts mocking actor Alec Baldwin over the tragic death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, who Baldwin accidentally killed after discharging a prop-gun on the set of his new movie “Rust” last week. “Don Jr. tops sick GOP Alec taunts with slimy T-shirt,” the newspaper’s subheading said of the garments emblazoned with the phrase, “Guns Don’t Kill People, Alec Baldwin Kills People.” Other Trump-adoring Republicans including Representative Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) and Ohio Senate hopeful J.D. Vance have also used the tragedy to taunt Baldwin, who impersonated the former president on “Saturday Night Live.”
