Victoria Beckham’s 90s looks were absolutely iconic, but it seems the woman herself is less keen on some of the Spice Girls outfits she wore.  The designer has said she would be “locked away by the fashion police” if she were to wear those clothes now, despite her kids thinking she looks “cool” Victoria was interviewed about her style evolution for the Wall Street Journal (£), where she admitted her kids love looking at old pictures of her and husband David.  Recalling one Cruz particularly loved, Posh said: “There’s one paparazzi picture of me going into Marks & Spencers and I’m on the phone, wearing tracksuit bottoms, some sort of trainer, and I’ve got a big silver puffer [jacket]. “Cruz sent me that image a couple weeks ago and was like, “Mom you look so cool; why don’t you dress like that anymore?” And I’m thinking, if I dressed like that now I’d be locked away by the fashion police.” She also name-checked another of her most infamous outfits – the matching black leather Gucci ensemble she wore with David in 1999.  “I will never, ever, ever, ever be allowed to forget that look,” she said. “The irony is that we wore full-on leather Gucci to a Versace event for Donatella. Which in itself was just so wrong.”  However, Victoria said that she has learned to “embrace” some of the “bad taste” in her old wardrobe, and now finds it “inspiring”.  She continued: “For example, there’s nothing wrong with PVC pants if you’re going to pair it with a beautiful white tuxedo shirt. That’s a different interpretation of how I would have worn it in the 90s. “Back then, I would have worn [PVC pants] with a bikini top with my boobs up by my chin, whereas now I’d wear [them] with a beautiful shoe and a tuxedo blouse.” Victoria added that she’s pretty sure her mum has the famous white bikini she wore at the 1997 Brit Awards “in a locker somewhere”, joking: “Maybe it’s time to get it back out.” Read the full interview with Victoria here.
