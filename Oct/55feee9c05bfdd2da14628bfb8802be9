Judi Love and dance partner Graziano Di Prima will miss this week’s Strictly Come Dancing after she tested positive for Covid.  The Loose Women panellist will not perform on Saturday’s live show, and has been given a one-week bye to next week’s Halloween spectacular.  A Strictly spokesperson said: “Judi Love has tested positive for Covid-19 and is now self-isolating following the latest government guidelines. “While Judi and Graziano will not be taking part in Strictly Come Dancing this weekend, Strictly Come Dancing protocols mean that all being well, they will return the following week.” In her own tweet, Judi said it was a “great disappointment” she would not be able to perform this weekend.  “Hoping to make a speedy recovery & dance for you next weekend,” she said. “Stay safe & thank you for your well wishes.” The pair had been due to perform a Cha Cha to Physical by Olivia Newton John on Saturday.  Judi is the second celebrity contestant to test positive for Covid this year, after Tom Fletcher also contracted the virus, along with his dance partner Amy Dowden.  Ugo Monye and Oti Mabuse were also forced to sit out a week of the competition due an old back injury of his that flared up. However, it has been confirmed they will be returning to the dancefloor this week. Earlier this month, Robert Webb and Dianne Buswell were also forced to withdraw from the BBC show due to the Peep Show star’s ongoing health issues. Last Sunday saw Judi and Graziano land in the dance-off for the second consecutive week, but were saved by the judges over Greg Wise and Karen Hauer.  Strictly Come Dancing continues on Saturday at 7.05pm on BBC One.
