Daniel Craig was honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Wednesday. “I never thought I’d hear myself saying this, but you know, it’s an absolute honour to be walked all over in Hollywood,” joked the James Bond star. “If happiness was measured by the company we keep, then me being on this pavement surrounded by all of these legends makes me a very, very, very happy man,” added the actor, whose final outing as 007 is in the newly-released No Time To Die. Daniel is the 2,704th celebrity to be honoured with a Hollywood star. His accolade sits just steps away from one dedicated to the late Roger Moore, who also played Bond. They are located on 7007 Hollywood Boulevard, a nod to the fictional British super spy’s code number in the franchise.  Rami Malek, who plays Bond’s nemesis Safin in No Time To Die, paid tribute to Craig during Wednesday’s presentation. “We all know he’s a superb actor, he’s dedicated, he can handle all his own stunts with one hand tied behind his back and the other holding a Negroni,” Rami said. “But he’s as fastidious about his craft as he is about his empathy for everyone around him,” the Bohemian Rhapsody star continued. “He has this ability to hold these two potentially opposing things at the same time — an incredible amount of talent and responsibility and an incredible warmth and acute awareness of what those around him need.” No Time To Die is in UK cinemas now.
