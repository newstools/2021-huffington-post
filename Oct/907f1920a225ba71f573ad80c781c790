But even those who feel the call of the wild sometimes crave a little luxury. If you’ve got a loved one who fancies themselves as an explorer, they’ve probably already got their basic kit down. They’ll have spent hours researching the best walking boots or choosing a tent with the lightest poles. What they might not have considered, is how much they’d enjoy a portable espresso machine, or perhaps some scented firelighters to get the campfire going. That’s where you can step in. Below, you’ll find some inspired gift ideas for people who love the outdoors. Some are upgrades on their regular kit, while others provide a bit of fun or a source of inspiration. Happy shopping!
