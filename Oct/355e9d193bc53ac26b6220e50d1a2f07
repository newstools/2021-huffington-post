By now, you’re probably familiar with Squid Game. The South Korean survival drama premiered in September on Netflix and quickly became an international sensation – reaching more than 111 million viewers by Oct 12, according to the streaming service. A few clear fan-favourite characters have emerged from the series, including Sae-byeok, played by model and actor HoYeon Jung. While Squid Game marked her acting debut and introduction to most US and UK audiences, the 27-year-old was already quite famous in her native country. Jung first hit the designer catwalks as a teenager, and she was a finalist on the fourth season of Korea’s Next Top Model in 2013. She made fashion headlines in 2016 thanks to her fiery red hair and captivating style.  The breakout star clearly continues to capture people’s attention. Earlier this month, she reportedly became the most followed South Korean actor on Instagram. She was also announced as Louis Vuitton’s newest global ambassador.  If you can’t get enough of Jung, we’ve rounded up 30 photos of her style evolution over the last eight years.
