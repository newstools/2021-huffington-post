Brooklyn Beckham made his TV cooking debut on Wednesday when he made an appearance on The Today Show, and to say it got a mixed response would be putting it mildly. The eldest son of David and Victoria Beckham recently tried his hand at cooking on social media, which naturally translated to being invited along to the US daytime show to make what was described as an “English breakfast sandwich”. Introduced as a “social media sensation and our friend”, Brooklyn told hosts Carson Daly and Hoda Kotb: “I’ve always loved food. And obviously when quarantine hit, I just really started to really get into it. My fiancée started filming me and I started posting it, and it’s just something that I just love doing.” After a quick shout-out to fiancée Nicola Peltz and some chat about how his dad loves cooking “anything… risotto, pasta, steak”, Brooklyn got started, and proceeded to whip up some bacon, egg and sausages.  It didn’t take long for the clip of Brooklyn in the kitchen to start doing the rounds online, with many alarmed at some of the culinary choices being made by the 22-year-old. Meanwhile others questioned exactly what the model and celebrity photographer’s credentials were to be educating America in the ways of sandwich-making: Where’s @GordonRamsay now giving his feedback? 😂 https://t.co/9j4Zl3iVC9 Having famous parents is a cheat code😭 https://t.co/WVY6CQQtaN Piers Morgan also later caught wind of the clip, branding it the “worst, most unutterably pointless segment in morning television history” (although in Brooklyn’s defence at least he made it to the end without walking off set). Worst, most unutterably pointless segment in morning television history? https://t.co/5A4JLF9WTh The segment did get the approval from Brooklyn’s famous parents, with Victoria commenting: “Well done Brooklyn, we love you.” David agreed: “Well done Bust… so good.”
