And sometimes it takes our nearest and dearest to actually treat us to one. We don’t mean booking a five star resort getaway because, let’s be honest, who can afford that right now?

Whether you’re looking for a present for someone who you know needs a chill out sesh or a gift for yourself to relax, here are a bunch of things you can buy that won’t break the bank.
