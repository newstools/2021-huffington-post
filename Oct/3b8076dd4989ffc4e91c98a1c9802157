England’s Covid R rate remained steady, according to the latest government figures. The UK Health Security Agency said on Friday the reproduction number is between 0.9 and 1.1, the same as last week. If R is greater than 1 the epidemic is generally seen to be growing; if R is less than 1 the epidemic is shrinking.
