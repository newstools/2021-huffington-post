Andy Murray released a video on Thursday asking for help from the public in his search for his wedding ring – which was bizarrely attached to his tennis shoes. The British tennis star is attending Indian Wells Masters, a Californian tennis tournament often dubbed the “fifth Grand Slam”.  It’s one of the only two Masters events Murray has not won in his career – but it looks like things aren’t off to a great start after this bizarre incident. In a tweet, Murray explained that the problems began when he realised his tennis shoes had made his car smell pretty bad. He said: “It’s been like 38, 39 degrees, so my tennis shoes are pretty damp, sweaty, and smelly, basically. “So when I got back to the hotel I decided my shoes needed to dry out.” The Brit then giggled when he revealed he decided to “leave my shoes under the car to let them get some air and dry them out overnight”. He continued: “Anyway, when I got back to the car in the morning, the shoes were gone – so my tennis shoes for the tournament had been stolen.” Murray explained he had to go shopping for some more shoes – “which was not the end of the world” – but it was not until his physio spotted that his wedding ring was missing that he began to realise what had happened. He continued: “I tie my wedding ring to my tennis shoes when I’m playing because I can’t play with it on my hand. “So, yeah, my wedding ring has been stolen as well. “Needless to say, I’m in the bad books at home. So, I want to try and find it, so if anyone can share this or may have any clue where it may be, that would be very helpful.”
