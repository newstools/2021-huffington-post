A pitch-perfect impression of Robin Williams is gaining stellar reviews online. Jamie Costa portrays the late actor, on the set of Mork And Mindy in 1982, heartachingly reacting to the death of his friend John Belushi in the five-minute video shared on YouTube. “Oh my goodness! This gave me goosebumps! There may have also been some tears,” wrote one person on Twitter. Added another: “Brilliant immersion in character, simple yet brilliant concept, great writing.” The clip’s name prompted speculation on social media that a hitherto unknown biopic about the Mrs Doubtfire star, who died in 2014, could be in the works. But, as SFist noted, the video could just be “a plucky attempt to generate interest in the possibility” of a Robin Williams film with Jamie Costa in the lead role. Jamie Costa did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for further information. Watch the video above.
