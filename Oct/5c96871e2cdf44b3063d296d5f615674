Kids don’t always use the dictionary-official words for things, but the terms they come up with are often even better than the real deal.  Lucky for us, the parents of Twitter share their children’s hilarious malapropisms and creative turns of phrase – from “ukalady” to “toe salon.” We’ve rounded up 30 funny tweets about what kids call things. Enjoy!  If my 4 y.o. Ever stops saying “cupcape” instead of “cupcake”, I’m burning the world to the ground. my 2 yo calls blueberries “booties”i love being a mom🤣🤣🤣🤣 Just when I thought my 4 year old saying  “cockcock” instead of chocolate was bad enough, he’s now started saying “cocklick” instead Need everyone to know my 4 year old calls Darth Vader “Darth Tomater” My daughter says “cheese” instead of “geez” and I swear I’m never correcting her because it’s the absolute cutest thing.“I just want to wear my pjs all day, cheese mom.” There has been a crew of roofers working at our house for a few days, and my 6yo refers to them as the “builder mans,” and now I shall hereinafter refer to any handy person as a Builder Man going forward. My 4 year old calls uppercase and lowercase “the big version” and “the little version” 🤣❤️ My daughter says "lasturday" instead of yesterday and I'd like her to be in charge of new words please. My kid is nearly ten, and just called cauliflower “white broccoli” because we don’t bring that disgusting vegetable into our home. 12 just called bugles “booglies “ So, that’s what they’re called now. Arguing with preteens is just too hard My preschooler just referred to diaper rash as “poopy rash” and I’ll never call it anything else now. :  My six year old calls thinking Brain School. My 8yo just referred to Santa as a “Christmas wizard.” My five-year-old just referred to my boobs as “long mountains” so let’s make that a thing. My toddler just referred to a fly as an “air-spider,” and now I’m thinking we should probably allow toddlers to name more things. One of the biggest challenges of parenthood is keeping a straight face when you tell your child not to say “chocolate pee pee”. My 7 year-old calls his big toe his “thumb toe” and I hope he never stops. Instead of “the weekend,” my 4yo calls Saturday and Sunday “iPad days,” if you’re wondering how my parenting is going.
