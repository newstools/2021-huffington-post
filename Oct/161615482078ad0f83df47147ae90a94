Strictly Come Dancing is off to Hollywood this Saturday as the show hosts its annual Movie Week special.  In anticipation of the third live show, bosses have revealed the full list of songs and dances the 14 remaining couples will be performing to, and it’s fair to say there’s something for everyone.  Among the films the contestants will be paying homage to are Avatar, Disney’s Sleeping Beauty, Titanic and an obligatory Back To The Future tribute from McFly’s Tom Fletcher. Meanwhile, Sara Davies appears to have drawn a bit of short straw as she’ll be dancing a routine inspired by Shrek, and Greg Wise will be channelling James Bond for the night. Check out the full list below...  This week sees the return of Tom Fletcher and his partner Amy Dowden to the competition, after they were forced to miss last week’s live show due to both testing positive for Covid-19. One couple who won’t be taking to the floor, however, is Nina Wadia and Neil Jones, who became the first pair to be voted off the show on Sunday.  Nina and Neil found themselves in the first dance-off of the series alongside Katie McGlynn and Gorka Marquez.  The former soap star later admitted she was “gutted” to be first out, telling It Takes Two on Monday: “I had so much more to give. And I wanted to spend so much more time with [Neil], more than my husband.” Strictly Come Dancing continues on Saturday at 6.45pm on BBC One.
