After a year off owing to the pandemic, the Strictly Come Dancing Halloween special is back this Saturday, and there’s quite the show lined up.  The BBC has revealed the list of spooky songs and dances the remaining 11 contestants will be performing to on Saturday.  Fans can look forward to last week’s leaderboard toppers John Whaite and Johannes Radebe dancing the Quickstep to Bad Moon Rising, while after setting tongues wagging with their Argentine Tango, AJ Odudu and Kai Widdrington will be taking on a Viennese Waltz to Ariana Grande’s Dangerous Woman. It is currently unknown if Judi Love and her professional dance partner Graziano Di Prima will be able to return to the competition this weekend as she is still in self-isolation after testing positive for Covid last week.  Strictly Come Dancing rules only allow a contestant a one-week bye if they are forced to miss a show, so they therefore have to withdraw should they be out of the competition any longer.  However, Strictly bosses have allowed Judi and Graziano to roll the Cha Cha they’d started preparing for last Saturday’s show over to the Halloween special, should they be able to perform.  Here’s the full list of songs and dances to watch out for... Last Sunday saw Ugo Monye and his partner Oti Mabuse eliminated from the competition, after landing in the dance off alongside Rhys Stephenson and Nancy Xu.  Strictly Come Dancing continues on Saturday at 7.10pm on BBC One.
