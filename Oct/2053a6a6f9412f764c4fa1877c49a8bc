Rising Covid cases means the UK has become one of the worst hotspots for the virus in the world in recent weeks. The government is currently resisting calls to implement restrictions in a bid to curb the virus, and has repeatedly claimed the timing is not right for another lockdown. Although 86% of the population aged 12 and above have received at least one vaccine dose – and 79% have received both doses – concerns about ongoing cases has led NHS representatives to call for Downing Street to enact plan B for the winter. But for now, prime minister Boris Johnson is relying on the booster vaccine rollout to help keep the virus at bay among the most vulnerable. Health secretary Sajid Javid also appealed for the public to wear their masks more often and announced that the government is going to buy antiviral drugs to tackle Covid.
