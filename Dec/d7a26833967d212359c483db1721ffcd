Boris Johnson has been hit by a huge Tory rebellion over plans to introduce Covid passes as Omicron sweeps through the UK – but it was not enough to derail so-called ‘Plan B’. MPs on Tuesday held a series of votes on Downing Street’s new Covid strategy, and 126 members of parliament made clear their unease with the mandatory introduction of Covid health certificates for large venues in England by voting against the measure. Some 369 MPs voted for the policy, a majority of 243. A breakdown of the vote suggested 98 Conservative voted against the policy. The division list showed 96 Conservative MPs voted against the Covid pass regulations. Two Tory MPs also acted as tellers for the noes. Eight Labour MPs, 10 Liberal Democrats, six DUP, Green Party MP Caroline Lucas and Independent MPs Jeremy Corbyn and Rob Roberts also opposed the regulations, according to the list. The number of MPs listed on the noes was 123, three short of the number announced in the chamber. In recent months, division lists have been updated to include names not initially published. The face mask mandate expansion passed easily, and new self-isolation measures went through without a vote. A vote on compulsory vaccines for NHS staff also received approval from MPs – but early signs suggested another substantial revolt. The votes were never in doubt given Labour’s support for the measures. The PM announced he wanted to introduce these stricter measures on December 8, explaining that it was now the “proportionate and responsible thing” to do following the surge in Omicron cases in the UK. Johnson has increased his warnings over the rapidly spreading new strain of Covid, telling a virtual Cabinet meeting a “huge spike of Omicron was coming”.
