Christmas is coming (really, really soon), which means it’s time to start thinking about Christmas Eve and your Christmas Eve boxes.  Traditionally, these are handed out on the evening of December 24, in a bid to get kids feeling festive before Christmas. But, they’re not just popular with children, grown ups love them too – and it’s easy to see why. Who wouldn’t want to be surprised with a box of treats? The concept is to fill a box with lots of lovely festive surprises to get everyone in a cosy mood for Christmas. Think: chocolate, a book, socks, a face mask, things to leave out for Santa – basically, anything that adds to the festive vibe and feeling cosy and warm, inside and out. The good news is that these boxes aren’t meant to contain anything too pricey – they’re simply meant to be a way to get everyone excited the night before the big day.  Wondering what to fill your Christmas Eve box with? Don’t worry, we’ve got you covered. Whether you’re preparing a box for the kids, for a partner, or for the whole family, this guide will sort you out.
