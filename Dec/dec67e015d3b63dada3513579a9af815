Ben Affleck, who has sought help for alcoholism multiple times throughout his acting career, has claimed he’d still be struggling to get sober had he remained in a marriage “that didn’t work” with ex-wife Jennifer Garner. “I’d probably still be drinking,” he said in a much-criticised interview on The Howard Stern Show shared by Access. “Part of why I started drinking alcohol was because I was trapped.” “I was like ’I can’t leave ’cause of my kids, but I’m not happy, what do I do?” he added, per People. “What I did was drink a bottle of scotch and fall asleep on the couch, which turned out not to be the solution.” Ben, who went to rehab in 2001, 2017 and 2018 – driven to a facility by his ex-wife in the latter instance years after their separation and following an intervention staged by her – noted that the marriage had hit a dead end for both parties. “The truth was we took our time, we made the decision ... we grew apart,” he said. “We had a marriage that didn’t work. This happens. “She’s somebody I love and respect but to whom I shouldn’t be married to any longer... Ultimately we we tried, we tried, we tried, because we had kids.” Jennifer Garner’s reps didn’t immediately reply to a HuffPost request for comment. But some observers on the internet found The Tender Bar actor’s remarks to be insensitive and egregiously casting blame on his ex-wife and the mother of his children. New York Post columnist Maureen Callahan wrote that Ben had given “the cruelest post-divorce interview since Brad Pitt blamed ex-wife Jennifer Aniston, in Parade magazine, for his deep unhappiness and subsequent affair with Angelina Jolie”. Piers Morgan also penned a column slamming Ben’s remarks in the Daily Mail, branding the actor’s remarks “astonishingly insensitive”.
