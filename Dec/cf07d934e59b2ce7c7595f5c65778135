We hope you love the products we recommend! All of them were independently selected by our editors. Just so you know, HuffPost UK may collect a share of sales or other compensation from the links on this page if you decide to shop from them. Oh, and FYI — prices are accurate and items in stock as of time of publication. Don’t waste your money paying full price for that perfume you’ve been wanting or those makeup brushes you’ve had your eye on – treat yourself in the Boots Boxing Day sale instead.  The sale has launched early this year, with discounts online from December 23 and in store from Boxing day. As always, the big Boots sale does not disappoint, with hundreds of items up to an incredible 50% off.  Whether you’re looking to treat yourself or you want to get a jump on next year’s Christmas shopping (yes, lots of people start their shopping for next year in the sales!), we’ve got you covered.
