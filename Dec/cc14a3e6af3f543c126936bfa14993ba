I’m A Celebrity presenters Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly have mocked Boris Johnson after footage emerged of officials joking about holding a Christmas party during lockdown last year. In what political commentators like to call “cut through”, the comedy duo used a segue on Tuesday night’s show to say that contestants “categorically deny” any suggestion they had a party in the Welsh castle. While introducing the next segment on I’m A Celebrity, Donnelly said: “It is all changing in camp now because yesterday the celebs chose a new leader via the gift of a secret vote.” McPartlin continued: “And that means David’s reign is over. But they weren’t celebrating. They categorically deny any suggestions that they had a party. “And this fictional party definitely didn’t involve cheese and wine, or a Secret Santa.” Donnelly then looked directly into the camera and said: “Evening prime minister… for now.” Good evening, Prime Minister! 👀🤭@antanddec #ImACeleb pic.twitter.com/cekIFiwx8N Footage obtained by ITV News Johnson showed aides joked about a Downing Street Christmas party just days after staff are alleged to have held a festive gathering in breach of lockdown rules. The prime minister’s then press secretary Allegra Stratton and adviser Ed Oldfield, along with other aides, were filmed joking about a “fictional” party in December 2020 in a video from a mock press conference obtained by ITV News. On Tuesday, Downing Street again insisted there was no Christmas party and coronavirus rules had been followed at all times.  It not the first time the pair has taken aim at the Tory administration this series. Last month, they roasted the PM about his speech to the Confederation of British Industry, during which he lost his place in his notes and asked the audience to “forgive me”.
