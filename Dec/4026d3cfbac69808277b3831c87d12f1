Phillip Schofield raised eyebrows during Tuesday morning’s edition of This Morning, with a question to Matt Hancock about the former health secretary’s breach of social distancing guidelines earlier this year. During the live broadcast, Phil and his co-host Holly Willoughby interviewed the MP about his calls for children to be screened for dyslexia – a condition Hancock was diagnosed with during his time at university – before they start secondary school. However, the presenter couldn’t resist a dig at the scandal Hancock found himself in over the summer, when he was pictured kissing an aide in his office, breaking social distancing measures in the process. Putting the former cabinet minister on the spot, Phil questioned: “Was it your dyslexia that meant you misread the social distancing rules?” “No, I can’t blame that on dyslexia or anything else,” Hancock stated. “In fact, I am not asking for any special favours because I am dyslexic. “In politics I have got some things to offer. In that case, that was a mistake and I have apologised for it.” "Was it your dyslexia that meant you misread the social distancing rules?" pic.twitter.com/zZx9yY1hdr He added: “It was a failure of leadership because I came on shows like this and asked people to do things and I didn’t follow the those rules myself.” When asked whether he thought his successor Sajid Javid was doing a better job than him, Hancock said: “Who knows? Because there’s so many uncertainties and new things hitting us like the new Omicron variant, but I think he’s doing a great job. “But, you know, in those jobs, the pressures are big but that’s no excuse. It was a failure of leadership on my part and I’ve apologised for that.” Phillip’s comment proved divisive on social media, with some praising the daytime host for grilling Hancock about the incident, while others suggested he was making light of the learning difficulty: Not a lot of people will agree with @MattHancock and his disgraceful behaviour in public office, but that was a very stupid question from the @thismorning Presenters. https://t.co/0sojW2sgcX Matt Hancock absolutely should be held to account.BUT when he guested on This Morning to discuss dyslexia, Philip Schofield asked him: "was it your dyslexia that made you misread the social distancing rules?"To use someone's neurodivergence against them to score points is vile. This is absolutely disgusting. Hold him to account for his piss poor handling of covid or his secret affair, don't make light of a disability for cheap laughs. @thismorning #Dyslexia https://t.co/flGH9J1SST This is an unnecessarily cruel, and unhelpful, question. https://t.co/KhQytRnfCD As much as I think @MattHancock needs to be challenged for his past actions and inactions - this reference to dyslexia is inappropriate to say the least. https://t.co/g8P1Qgwubm There are SO many cheap shots you can make at Matt Hancock, his dyslexia really shouldn’t be one of them https://t.co/XMRo35xU1W Ableism is not the look you think it is ITV https://t.co/CQeoE3vh65 Absolutely savage from Philhttps://t.co/XstIfN5nrM Haha yes @Schofe going straight for the jugular with his social distancing questions to Hancock the creep #ThisMorning phillip schofield just asked matt hancock on this morning if his dyslexia was the reason for his mishandling of the pandemic HHAHAHAHAHA @Schofe on this morning calling out Matt Hancock for not following social distancing on @thismorning had me gasping… then laughing @Schofe had to come here to commend you for that last question to Matt Hancock! Phil: Was it your dyslexia that meant you misread the social distancing rules? YAAAAS PHILLIP! 😂😂#ThisMorning pic.twitter.com/IbzllfwqsY Phillip Schofield as Matt Hancock left the studio… #ThisMorning pic.twitter.com/QhYadtDATH HuffPost UK has contacted ITV for comment. Matt Hancock resigned from his position as health secretary in June, after photos of him kissing his aide were published in the media. He said in a video posted on his Twitter account at the time: “I understand the enormous sacrifices that everybody in this country has made – that you have made. “And those of us who make these rules have got to stick by them, and that’s why I’ve got to resign.” This Morning airs every weekday from 10am on ITV.
