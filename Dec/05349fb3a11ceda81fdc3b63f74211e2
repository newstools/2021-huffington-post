The world of showbiz never fails to deliver plenty of moments that leave us all asking WTF?, but 2021 really was a vintage year for jaw-dropping scenes. There was plenty of oversharing, naked antics, and not one, but two terrifying celebrity snake encounters. Oh and Shakira fending off a group of wild boars in a Barcelona street. You honestly couldn’t make it up. Coronation Street actor Harry Visinoni spotted this four-foot long python behind the toilet in his bathroom as he cleaned his teeth one night. Brrrrrrr. The chat show host revealed how he used some unusual objects to learn about intimacy in his teenage years.  Admitting he was a late bloomer who had not kissed a girl until he was 17, the comedian said: “I didn’t know anything about sex. “I became very interested in women’s magazines and would read my mum’s to try and pick out clues as to what women were. “One section said, ‘How to get your man better at oral sex’. It said, ‘Peel the orange and the whole in the middle, insert your tongue’, so I felt, ’This is something I need to learn.” He later added: “I’d read that female-to-male oral sex could be replicated with a Hoover, which was a very uncomfortable experience and not pleasant for anyone.” We’ll never look at Henry’s smiling face in the same way ever again. The former Bake Off host admitted she“snotted” into a grumbling actor’s food while serving up food on a film set. “Never, ever treat a waitress badly. You’ll end up with snot… or worse... in your food,” she warned. Wow. Wrong. It was actually her 80-year-old mother. Amazing.

If it’s a cold day then my winkle looks like a little slug lying on an apple.” TMI, Danny, TMI. Looool the most random phone call ever https://t.co/u0FQEiCXQD My cousin in Trinidad won’t get the vaccine cuz his friend got it & became impotent. His testicles became swollen. His friend was weeks away from getting married, now the girl called off the wedding. So just pray on it & make sure you’re comfortable with ur decision, not bullied Nicki. I’m double vaxxed & now I get harder than ever. pic.twitter.com/6QNfkePzqu “I like whole grain toast with salt on it. It’s that carbohydrate that makes you feel comforted and I love salt,” the former Spice Girls star revealed. Accompanied by five pints of water, we’re guessing? Speaking in Spanish, the Columbian singer explained in a video: “Look at how the two wild boars that attacked me in the park have left my bag. “They were taking my bag to the woods with my phone in it. They’ve destroyed everything.” This isn’t the first time Shakira has found herself targeted by members of the animal kingdom. Back in 2012, she recalled how a sea lion had tried to “attack” her after she tried to take its photo on her phone during a visit to South Africa. The former TOWIE star said she “felt sick” at how much she’d splurged the morning after the meaty meal at Salt Bae’s London restaurant.

Momma and Vivi at H&M London. The baby might have run out of clothes from their Euro sojourn😀. London is the next stop for the Eternals premier & press junket.#AngelinaJolie #Eternals pic.twitter.com/mpF2kDuO1p The musical theatre impresario played his first-ever DJ set to celebrate the reopening of his stage show Phantom Of The Opera on Broadway... and things went OFF.  Carl Cox who? I did not have Andrew Lloyd Webber doing a DJ set outside of the Majestic Theatre and playing “Rain On Me” by Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande on my 2021 bingo card. pic.twitter.com/nnusbGclGl We think tweet pretty much sums up how everyone who braved the Channel 4 doc felt after watching. What a terrible day to have eyes#breastfeedingmyboyfriend pic.twitter.com/eKj40uYOxL The singer recounted a particularly mortifying story during an appearance on Never Mind The Buzzcocks about when she played Coachella in 2016, while suffering from a stomach bug. “The last time I played Coachella, I had a stomach bug,” Ellie explained. “I thought that something could happen downstairs. “It just so happened a band – I think it was Kings Of Leon, I can’t remember – they had a cat litter which they used to pee in with other humans.” When she was asked by panellist Jamali Maddix if she “thought you were going to shit yourself?”, Ellie replied, “Well, yes.” She added: “There was talk about me wearing an adult [nappy].” Ellie clarified: “I was wearing leather shorts. Look it’s not going to go anywhere! It’s not going to soak up in the leather – it’s just going to come out. So it just so happened the design included a zip all the way around so I could just run off and…” She then added: “I had a poo trap door.” Lovely.
