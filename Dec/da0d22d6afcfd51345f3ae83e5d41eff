After all, they’ve (probably) already got their go-to favourite foodie products.  So it’s time to get inventive, what wouldn’t they have bought for themselves? What would be an extra special treat?  It could be a vegan cheese-making kit, and a fancy vegan ‘leather’ bag. Or, perhaps some laugh out loud wall art is more their style.  We’ve got all that and more in our Amazon-based vegan gift guide. Whether you’re buying for a friend, co-worker, partner, or family member, when it comes to vegan gift options, there’s something for everyone.
