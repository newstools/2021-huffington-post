This article contains spoilers about Tuesday’s Celebrity MasterChef Christmas Cook-Off. Channel 5 News has issued an apology after revealing the winner of Celebrity MasterChef’s Christmas special before it had even aired on the BBC. The first Christmas Cook-Off saw comedian and Loose Women panellist Judi Love crowned champion, winning one of two golden whisk trophies up for grabs this year. In the festive episode, the Strictly Come Dancing contestant went head to head with former TOWIE star Joey Essex, Strictly pro Oti Mabuse, ex-footballer Neil Ruddock, and comedy star Su Pollard to claim the title. However, minutes before Celebrity MasterChef was due to air on BBC One at 8pm, Channel 5 News accidentally spoiled the result. Later in the evening, Channel 5 News posted an apology on Twitter, which read: “We would like to say sorry for mistakenly announcing the winner of BBC1’s Celebrity Masterchef before it was revealed on the programme tonight. “Apologies to all fans of the show.” We would like to say sorry for mistakenly announcing the winner of BBC1's Celebrity Masterchef before it was revealed on the programme tonight.
