The countdown to the biggest night in British music is officially on. On Saturday, the Brit Awards announced the contenders for next year’s awards show, with some of the most popular UK acts in the industry in the running for the top prizes of the night. It’s probably no surprise that Adele is among the top nominees leading the way this time around, with Ed Sheeran, Dave and Little Simz joining her on four nods each. All four of these artists are in the running for the coveted Album Of The Year prize, as well as being nominated in the inaugural Best British Artist category, after organisers ditching gendered awards ahead of the 2022 ceremony. Meanwhile, in what organisers have described as another move towards inclusivity, new genre-specific categories have been introduced for acts representing Pop/R&B, Alternative/Rock, Hip-Hop/Grime/Rap Act and Dance music.  Other UK-centric acts in the running include Sam Fender, Little Mix, Dua Lipa and Coldplay, each on two nominations, while international acts like Lil Nas X, Billie Eilish, Central Cee, David Guetta and reigning Eurovision winners Måneskin are also up for multiple prizes. Here is the full list of nominees...
