You can also opt to overhaul your beauty routine and swap out your non-vegan products for some plant-based, cruelty-free alternatives. (Trust us, it’s actually far easier than you might think...) If you’re serious about going completely vegan for the month – or for the longer term – a vegan skincare routine is essential. Of course, knowing where to start when it comes to selecting a whole new range of products (and ingredient profiles) to use can seem a little daunting, can’t it?  Don’t panic, we’ve got you and your skin covered with our guide to all of the very best (and super easy to use) vegan skincare.
