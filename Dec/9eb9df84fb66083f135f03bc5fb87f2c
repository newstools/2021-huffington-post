There are a number of stars who will be glad to see the back of 2021 after the rest of us witnessed them eff-ing up royally. And you know what these celebs really don’t need as we bid farewell to the past 12 months? A round-up reminding everyone of their very public humiliations... Lorraine was left mortified after getting her words mixed up during an interview with Bridgerton’s Jonathan Bailey back in January during a discussion about him having make-up applied to his backside. Weather presenter Laura Tobin served up a golden TV blooper when she accidentally announced the arrival of some “slutty deposits” during her forecast. “Have you still got your dog?” Alison asked Graham. “No. Dead,” Graham replied. Awks. “It became clear at one point to me, to both of us, that I needed a bikini line wax,” Kyra explained.  “I’m not saying it was a disaster, but the fact that we did not have to go to the emergency room was just an absolute miracle.” Ouch. The TV chef was overheard swearing as he was unable to see the autocue. Today’s Saturday Kitchen intro gets the “Joe Wicks Award” for the mics being turned up too early. Joyous @matt_tebbutt #SaturdayKitchen @BBCOne pic.twitter.com/OfP7gXXmox When you’ve forked out 70 quid for a candle, you want it to, you know, work rather than explode. So spare a thought for the woman who was gifted one of Gwyneth Paltrow’s luxe candles from her Goop lifestyle brand, only for it to go up in the wrong kind of flames when it exploded in her London home.  At least Twitter saw the funny side... I hope the woman in question is okay - but I do find this fanny. https://t.co/I9y51jcVkT Despite being set in the 19th century, many Bridgerton viewers pointed out a glaring mistake that producers of the hit show failed to spot. Fans quite rightly pointed out that the Brits living in Regency-era Bath must have been pioneers because it looks like they had already invented yellow lines restricting where they could park their horse-drawn carriages.

And if so, were viewers meant to find out? #bbcnews pic.twitter.com/hzy4euQRY6 Cue presenter Hue Edwards making a swift apology. No prizes for guessing where the Bake Off champ ended up when he tried his hand at paddle boarding on Steph’s Packed Lunch. Seriously Spike, you had one job. On a frôlé la catastrophe et une annonce un peu prématurée de la Palme d'or 😱 #Cannes2021 pic.twitter.com/8uBfYl2orI The presenter wasn’t at her desk for a live broadcast of BBC News back in August, but she could be seen in the background comically bent over as she struggled to get her high heels on, before putting her best (dressed) feet forward to deliver the bulletin. Priorities.
