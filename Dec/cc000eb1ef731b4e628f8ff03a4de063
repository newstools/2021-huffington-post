Let’s face it, 2021 has been an interesting year to say, if “interesting” means challenging, exhausting and seemingly endless.  In fact, the entire past 22 months have been something of a blur and now 2022 is almost upon us with all the promise and uncertainty a new year brings. The bit between Christmas and New Year’s Eve is often a time we spend reflecting and we have a lot to think about 2021. From our work and career to our friendships and relationships, the year has been trying for all of us.  What better way to reflect on this than with the help of the right book? Our roundup below is made up of books we’ve personally read and enjoyed this year and will definitely give you food for thought about your life and plans.  From The Defining Decade to How To Work Without Losing Your Mind, we hope you’ll find something of what you need in this reading list to get some closure on 2021 and look ahead to brighter days.
