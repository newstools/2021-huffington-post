Somehow we’re at the end of 2021 (time really has flown by this year), which means that if you haven’t already started thinking about your planner for 2022, now is the time.  Whether you’re a traditional diary user, a bullet journaling addict, or someone who likes to use mindfulness and gratitude to journal, you’re going to need to replace your current journal with a fresh new planner.  Admittedly, with so many amazing designs to choose from, it can be somewhat overwhelming selecting a new planner (I know I personally always struggle to pick just one). To help you to find the perfect planner to get 2022 off to a superb start, we’ve pulled together a list of all the best-rated diaries, journals and planners on Amazon.
