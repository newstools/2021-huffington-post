Rihanna’s wax figure at Madame Tussauds in Berlin needs work, work, work work, work, work. The museum this month dressed their likeness of the singer in a Christmas outfit, but it wasn’t the seasonal attire that got every’s attention. It was the statue’s poor resemblance to the nine-time Grammy winner. “Rihanna Wax Figure Apparently Made By Someone Who’s Never Seen Rihanna,” blared one headline. The fan response on Twitter also declared the exhibit to be in a hopeless place. “That wax figure of Rihanna is a hate crime,” one person tweeted. Barbados last month officially declared the Diamonds singer to be a national hero. But to many her wax stand-in, unveiled in 2011, rates a zero. The good Madame's Rihanna wax figure looks like a white person with a nose that got sunburned but is on the road to recovery. I lookmore like Rihanna than her wax figure does. https://t.co/CY4wb2Sujn that wax figure of rihanna is a hate crime.
