Gogglebox viewers have praised the show’s stars for “speaking for the nation” after the Channel 4 series featured a news item about the alleged Christmas party held at Downing Street during lockdown last year. On Friday’s episode, the Goggleboxers didn’t hold back in saying what they thought whilst watching a clip of Boris Johnson’s spokesperson Allegra Stratton laughing about the event in a leaked video. She has since resigned. “Get your stories straight,” Giles commented. Pete Sandiford said: “Over 500 a day were dying, and she’s laughing about a party in Downing Street.” While his sister, Sophie, had some humour to add, joking: “She hasn’t got an Allegra to stand on.” An enraged Helena said: “Look at them laughing their heads off the bunch of twats. “They’re laughing at us, they’re laughing at the NHS and all the hard work everybody’s done.” Viewers were quick to praise the show’s stars for their response to the scandal... "They can shove their cheese up their arse"#Gogglebox speaking for the whole nation once again on the most important matters of the day As ever #Gogglebox speaking for the British people - seeing thru the crap that has been spouted from Downing Street this week"You can shove your cheese up your arse" indeed So pleased to see #Gogglebox angry too. We have been made to feel like we were overreacting to these parties. It is not one person angry but all. “They’re laughing at us, they’re laughing at the NHS, and they’re laughing at all the hard work that everybody’s done… they can shove their cheese up their arse!”  I 100% agree.  #Gogglebox As expected, Gogglebox on politics this week was 🔥🔥🔥“They’re laughing at us.
