Tom Daley melted hearts when he was spotted knitting in an Olympic crowd at the Tokyo 2020 Games earlier this week, and now he’s debuted one of his finished products.  The British diver is known for his love of knitting and crochet, and even has a dedicated Instagram account for the things he makes, which he often uses to help raise money for charity.   To mark his participation in the Games – where he has already won his first gold – Tom said he wanted to make something special, and created a commemorative Olympic cardigan.  Showing off the finished product on Instagram, Tom wrote: “When I got to Tokyo, I wanted to make something that would remind me of these games. Something that I could say I had made in Tokyo, during the Olympics! “I did a @teamgb logo on the back, with a flag and GBR on the shoulders and Tokyo embroidered onto the front!” He also asked his followers to donate to money for The Brain Tumour Charity in memory of his dad Robert, who died in 2011 from a brain tumour. After his and diving partner Matty Lee’s triumph in the men’s synchronised 10-metre event last week, Tom also knitted a special pouch to stop his gold medal from getting scratched.  After four Olympics and two previous bronze medals, it marked Tom’s first gold at the games.  Tom made his Olympic debut as a 14-year-old in Beijing 2008, before finishing third in the 10m platform in London 2012 and synchronised 10m platform in Rio in 2016. He is back competing again in Tokyo on Friday in the preliminary round of the 10m platform.
