They might be five years old, but we still haven’t fully recovered from those naked paddle board photos of Orlando Bloom, and now he’s at it again. The Pirates Of The Caribbean star’s love of stripping off in public clearly shows no sign of waning, after he shared a series of snaps and a video of him skinny-dipping on Instagram on Sunday. The 44-year-old British actor shared footage of his impressive (ahem) backstroke, but it was the final pic of him standing in his birthday suit on the edge of a lake that raised the most eyebrows. However, unlike those naked paddle board pics that went viral back in 2016, this time Orlando left a little to the imagination, covering up his derriere with a well-placed peach emoji.  Orlando made headlines around the world and sent the internet into meltdown five years ago when photos of him and his now-fiancée Katy Perry went viral. In the snaps, Katy can be seen sat at the front of the paddle board as a very naked Orlando kneels behind her. The following year, he reflected on the viral moment during an interview with Elle, explaining he “had a moment of feeling free”. “I’ve been photographed a million times in a million different ways,” he told the magazine. “I have a good radar.” He continued: “We’d been completely alone for five days. Nothing around us. There was no way anyone could get anything. “So I had a moment of feeling free… What can I tell you? Note to self: you’re never free. Ha!”
