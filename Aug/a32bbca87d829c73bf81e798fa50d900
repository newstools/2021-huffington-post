Mr. Lordi received the COVID-19 vaccine in full costume — and it rocked. The lead singer of Finnish hard rock band Lordi got his second dose on Sunday at a pop-up vaccination center in Rovaniemi. “They put a big needle in my arm, and that’s exactly why I came here,” the 47-year-old, whose real name is Tomi Petteri Putaansuu, told news site Yle. The group is famed for wearing monster masks on stage: And for their surprise victory at the 2006 Eurovision Song Contest with their anthem Hard Rock Hallelujah.
