Britney Spears has paid tribute to boyfriend Sam Asghari﻿ for his support during her “hardest years”. The chart-topping singer is currently fighting to have her father Jamie Spears removed as her legal conservator, a position that has seen him and other parties in control of her finances and various aspects of her personal life since 2008. Amid the legal battle, Britney thanked him for standing by her in a post dedicated to him on Instagram.  Sharing a picture of them together, the pop superstar wrote: “Not only has this cute asshole been with me through the hardest years of my life but he happens to be an extremely good cook.” She then made a tongue-in-cheek bid to land him an action film role. “Fast & Furious franchise, don’t miss out on your next star,” Britney joked.  Britney met the Iranian-born actor and personal trainer on the set of a music video in 2016. Sam frequently shares support for Britney on social media as she pushes to be freed from her conservatorship. In her bombshell court testimony earlier this year, Britney claimed she wanted to get married and have more children but was being prevented from doing so by the arrangement she was placed under after suffering a series of mental breakdowns. Britney also claimed she wanted to “sue my family” for their part in the legal arrangement, telling a court more recently that she wanted her dad to be charged with “conservatorship abuse”. Jamie Spears’ attorneys have denied any wrongdoing. Her father has agreed to her demand he step down from his role overseeing her estate, though no timeline for walking away has been set. The next hearing in the case is scheduled for September.
