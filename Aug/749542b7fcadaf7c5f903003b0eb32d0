The stars of the upcoming live-action Cinderella film banded together for a bizarre and somewhat unsettling attempt to promote the movie. A costumed James Corden, Camila Cabello, Idina Menzel and Billy Porter – along with a group of background dancers – held up traffic at a Los Angeles intersection while singing Jennifer Lopez’s Let’s Get Loud in a video shared by the Twitter account Film Updates over the weekend. While some people may have found this festive and fun, the stunt mostly received derision and rage on Twitter. Out of the cast members, James Corden bore the brunt of the mockery, probably because he was the one dressed as a mouse and thrusting his pelvis at the air. imagine u died cuz u couldnt get to the hospital in time bc of this https://t.co/V60x2ef7Eh Is this why people hate theater kids? James Corden does so much work and gets cast in so much stuff that gets shoved in front of so many eyeballs, and it all fucking sucks ass and everybody hates it. No wonder people think he's a psyop This should be legally recognized as a hate crime and an act of terrorism https://t.co/DpVB6AxVsRpic.twitter.com/sBCMRNkVDn what if this happened and youre late for work and get fired. your boss isnt gonna believe you unless you have a recording of it https://t.co/PYCZ6LBWp4 You let James Corden get too powerful. Look at us now. Look how far we’ve fallen. Not even God’s light can reach us now. You pierced the veil and let in something that was never meant to be a part of this universe. And he hungers. Nothing will satiate but the end of everything. https://t.co/cLyM5VwRJ6
