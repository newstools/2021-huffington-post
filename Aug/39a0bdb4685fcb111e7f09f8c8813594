UK cities definitely have an expensive reputation – but a new study suggests some have actually become more affordable in the pandemic. House-buyers in the UK do now spend 8.1 times more than their average salary to secure their homes, according to Halifax’s new findings. This is a steep increase compared to just 10 years ago, when buyers spent just 5.6 times their earnings when purchasing a house. The good news is the findings also suggested British cities are now slightly more affordable to live in than the UK as a whole. This may be down to the wave of city-dwellers who flocked to the countryside during the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns, triggering an increase in house prices there. The bad news is, the house price-to-earnings ratio in UK cities has increased steadily over the last eight years. So which are the least – most – expensive cities to settle down in, according to Halifax? The following places have been ranked according to their price-to-earnings ratio, a number which is based on the average house price in that city compared to the average annual earnings. 1.
