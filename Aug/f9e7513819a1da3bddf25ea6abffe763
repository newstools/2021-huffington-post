Gogglebox star Andy Michael has died at the age of 61 following a short illness, a statement from Channel 4 and Studio Lambert on behalf of his family has said. Andy and his family first appeared on Gogglebox when the show debuted  in 2013, but announced a year later that they were leaving because he was planning to run for Ukip in the upcoming general election. When he failed to secure the Hastings and Rye seat, the family returned for future episodes. In their statement, Channel 4 confirmed that Andy died last week, surrounded by his family. The statement – given to the PA news agency – said: “We are deeply saddened to share the passing of Gogglebox star Andy Michael at the age of 61 following a short illness. “Andy passed away last weekend with his family by his side.” They continued: “Retired hotelier Andy, who brought much wit and insight to Gogglebox, was one of the show’s original cast members, appearing in the very first episode in 2013. “Beloved father to Katy, Alex, Pascal and Louis, and cherished husband of Carolyne, Andy was a much-loved and respected member of the Gogglebox family, and he will be very sadly missed. “Our love and thoughts are with Carolyne and the entire family.
