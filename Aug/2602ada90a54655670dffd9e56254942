Princess Diana was famous for her humanitarian work, style, and kindness. But perhaps one of her most beautiful contributions to the world was her role as a mother to Prince William and Prince Harry. In honour of her memory, we’ve compiled some of Princess Diana’s best quotes about motherhood.  “I want my boys to have an understanding of people’s emotions, their insecurities, people’s distress and their hopes and dreams.” “I was [a little sad] because it’s opening another chapter in my life and certainly William’s. But he’s ready for it. He’s a very independent child.”  “Then I was unwell with postnatal depression, which no one ever discusses, postnatal depression, you have to read about it afterwards, and that in itself was a bit of a difficult time. You’d wake up in the morning feeling you didn’t want to get out of bed, you felt misunderstood, and just very, very low in yourself ... People see it as crying wolf or attention-seeking, and they think because you’re in the media all the time you’ve got enough attention, inverted commas. But I was actually crying out because I wanted to get better in order to go forward and continue my duty and my role as wife, mother, Princess of Wales.”  “I live for my sons. I would be lost without them.” “Hugs can do great amounts of good, especially for children.” “Well, with William and Harry, for instance, I take them round homelessness projects, I’ve taken William and Harry to people dying of AIDs ― albeit I told them it was cancer ― I’ve taken the children to all sorts of areas where I’m not sure anyone of that age in this family has been before.” “I will fight for my children on any level so they can reach their potential as human beings, and in their public duties.” “Don’t call me an icon. I’m just a mother trying to help.”
