But with a hybrid commuting / work-from-home model becoming the norm, there’s going to be plenty of lugging laptops back and forth for the foreseeable – and your trusty canvas bag is no longer likely to cut it. It’s time to invest in a proper bag that can hold all your stuff without breaking your back. But you needn’t sacrifice style – we’ve rounded up a nice selection of backpacks that have plenty of room for your computer, laptop cords, work snacks and gym gear, but still look and feel good, too. Happy shopping – and commuting!
