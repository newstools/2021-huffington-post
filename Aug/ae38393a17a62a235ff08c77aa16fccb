Changing Rooms might have had a lick of paint with its shiny-new Channel 4 reboot, but it proved to be the same ridiculous show it always was when it returned on Wednesday night.  It had been 17 years since Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen and the gang last launched an assault on the living rooms of misguided contestants armed with MDF and pots of garish paint colours. It was like stepping back in time as new host Anna Richardson took the reins of the former BBC show.  While there were some elements of the original series missing (Handy Andy, sob), the transformations were just as, errrrm, shocking, as they were previously – and people had a lot of thoughts... Changing Rooms airs Wednesdays at 8pm on Channel 4.
