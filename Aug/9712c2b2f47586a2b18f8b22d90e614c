Little Mix singer Leigh-Anne Pinnock has announced that she and her partner Andre Gray have welcomed twins. Leigh-Anne shared the news on Instagram on Monday afternoon, posting a close-up of her newborns’ feet. “We asked for a miracle, we were given two,” she wrote. “Our Cubbies are here.” She also told her followers that the twins were born last week, on 16 August. Soon after publicly sharing her news, Leigh-Anne’s bandmate Perrie Edwards – who gave birth to her first child last week – commented: “Two bundles of absolute joy! I love you my Lee Lee.” Leigh-Anne announced she was expecting back in May, telling fans: “We’ve dreamed about this moment for so long and we can’t believe the dream is finally coming true.” The chart-topping singer has shared a series of pregnancy snaps on social media over the last few months, but chose not to disclose that she was pregnant with twins until after the birth. The news of Leigh-Anne and Andre’s new arrivals comes just days after Perrie also announced that she’d given birth. Posting a similar photo of her newborn, Perrie wrote on Instagram: “Welcome to the world baby 21/08/21” Leigh-Anne wrote under Perrie’s post: “I am so proud of you and I love you so much... what an angel.” Similarly, fellow Little Mix star Jade Thirlwall commented: “Proud of you always. Ly.” It’s been an exciting few weeks for Leigh-Anne – who is not only celebrating the birth of her own babies, but the arrival of her nephew, after her sister Sairah Pinnock gave birth last week. Little Mix manager Samantha Cox also announced her own pregnancy around the same time as Perrie and Leigh-Anne.
