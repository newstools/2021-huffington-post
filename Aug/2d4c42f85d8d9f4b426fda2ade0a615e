The death of Matthew Mindler, a former child actor and star of the comedy Our Idiot Brother, has been ruled as a suicide. Over the weekend, Matthew was found dead at the age of 19, days after being reported as missing from Millersville University, Pennsylvania, where he was a first year student. Lancaster County Coroner’s Office later began an investigation, and has now ruled that the 19-year-old took his own life.  As a child, Matthew played River – the son of Steve Coogan’s character – in the Paul Rudd comedy Our Idiot Brother, which also starred Elizabeth Banks, Zooey Deschanel and Emily Mortimer. His additional credits included the US soap As The World Turns and a number of short films. The young performer’s final on-screen appearance was in the TV movie Chad: An American Boy in 2016. A statement issued by Millersville University president Daniel A Wubah after the news of Matthew’s death was confirmed read: “It is with a grieving heart that I let you know of the death of 19-year-old Matthew Mindler from Hellertown, Pennsylvania, a first-year student at Millersville University. “Our thoughts of comfort and peace are with his family and friends during this difficult time… This is a time of grief for the family, our campus and the community. I ask that the campus community come together to support each other, and our students, during this difficult time.” A subsequent tweet from Millersville University﻿ added: “There is no public safety threat to the University community. The Lancter County Coroner’s Office is actively investigating.” Help and support:
