A Friends fan has unearthed a magazine article that predicted what the cast would look like 20 years after the show ended.  When the show wrapped up back in 2004, a magazine used Photoshop to mock up what how the ageing process would affect Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, David Schwimmer and Matthew Perry.  And let’s just say it wasn’t the kindest of predictions... For reference, this is what the Friends cast looked like back in 2004:  And this is how they’re looking these days: So, unless the next three years prove to be particularly unkind to the cast, we can conclude that the magazine’s prediction was way off.  The Friends cast came together for the one-off non-scripted special back in May, which was the first time they had all been on TV together since the sitcom finished back in 2004.  During the special, there were a number of revelations and surprises, including Lisa’s Smelly Cat duet with Lady Gaga and David’s Schwimmer’s admission that life nearly imitated art for himself and Jennifer Aniston﻿.  A number of guest stars including James Michael Tyler, Maggie Wheeler, Christina Pickles and Elliot Gould shared their special memories of the show, while there were also appearances from A-list fans including Justin Bieber, BTS, David Beckham and Malala Yousafzai.
