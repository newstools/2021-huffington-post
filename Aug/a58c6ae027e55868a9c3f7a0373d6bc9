Timothée Chalamet has caused a stir with the latest photo shared on his Instagram page. On Friday, the 25-year-old posted a couple of pictures of himself lounging on some fairly nondescript grass, enjoying the sunshine. So far, so ordinary, right? Well, take a closer look at the snaps below, and see if anything in the backdrop looks familiar. You see, Timothée’s extra-devoted fans did some digging to try and work out where in the world he was, and they managed to decipher from a couple of subtle clues that he was at Elstree Studios, the home of shows like Strictly Come Dancing, The Crown and EastEnders. And that backdrop? It actually belongs to none other than Holby City. Holby City cast member David Ames was quick to pick up on the news about Timothée’s whereabouts, even recreating the Call Me By Your Name star’s poses during filming with co-star Chan Woo Lim: And naturally, fans had a lot of questions: HuffPost UK has contacted the BBC for further comment about exactly what Timothée Chalamet was doing hanging out on the set of Holby City. Earlier this year it was announced that Holby City would be coming to an end after more than 20 years on the air, with the medical drama’s final episode set to be shown in March 2022. Meanwhile, Timothée is currently gearing up for the long-awaited release of his new sci-fi film Dune, the first in a two-part adaptation of the book of the same name. Dune was supposed to have hit cinemas in November 2020, but this was pushed back by a year due to the pandemic.
