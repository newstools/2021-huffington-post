Dame Sarah Storey has equalled Team GB’s Paralympic gold medals record by claiming the 16th of her career. The cyclist stormed to victory in the women’s C5 time trial at the Tokyo Games on Tuesday within a time of 36:08.90.  Fellow GB rider Crystal Lane-Wright also took home silver in Tuesday’s event, with a time of 37:40.89. Sarah’s Paralympic gold total now matches the achievement of former swimmer Mike Kenny, who took home 16 during his career. While she must wait until Thursday’s C4-5 road race for a chance to fully surpass 76-year-old Mike when it comes to golds, she already has more overall medals with a total haul of 27 to his 18. Speaking after her win, Sarah said: “I never set out on this journey to be Britain’s greatest Paralympian, but to match the best man and to have more other medals is just a dream come true – well, it is almost a dream that was not one. “The closer we have got to Tokyo, the more it has been like: This is a possibility. It really could happen. You just don’t know. “I am just so chuffed. I have been preparing for this for such a long time. It is such a sweet feeling. Sweet 16!! Can I be 16 again?!”. The last of Mike’s 16 titles and two silvers came in Seoul in 1988, four years before Sarah kicked off her own Paralympic career as a 14-year-old swimmer in Barcelona. She won five golds in the pool across four Games before a seamless transition to the bike ahead of Beijing 2008, which has brought even greater rewards.
