Former Love Island star Liberty Poole has given her first interview since making the decision to leave the show. Liberty had been romantically linked with Jake Cornish since they entered the Love Island villa on day one, and remained in a relationship until their eventual split earlier this week. Since then, both Liberty and Jake made the decision to leave the villa, just days before this year’s winning couple is set to be crowned. Reflecting on the choices she made over the course of the series in an interview with The Sun, Liberty insisted that she stood by them all. On the decision for Jake and herself to call time on their relationship, Liberty told the newspaper: “It might be different from a viewers’ perspective but I am happy I made the decision I did. “Even if [Jake] had said [he wanted to] give it a go there were already things in my mind that we weren’t right for each other. “If he had said, ‘Let’s give it a go,’ it would not have been the right decision. I made the right decision for the both of us so we could both go our separate ways.” After looking back over the issues that blighted her relationship with Jake, Liberty added: “I did the right thing.”  Prior to their joint exit, Liberty and Jake were given the opportunity to clear the air on one last date, before returning to the villa to break the news to the rest of the Islanders that they were leaving. Just four couples now remain in the villa, with the winning pair being crowned live on Monday night. Love Island continues on Sunday night at 9pm.
