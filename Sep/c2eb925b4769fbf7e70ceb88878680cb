As the nation settles into hybrid working, many of the country’s city dwellers are reevaluating their homes – with some setting their sites on greener pastures.  The chance to work remotely has led to a spike in house hunters looking for a change of scenery, according to Zoopla, with breezy sea views and rolling hills now top of the wish list. When looking for a new destination, areas of natural beauty (AONB) are popular. England, Wales, and Northern Ireland boast 46 AONBs, with a further 40 national scenic areas (NSAs) in Scotland. So, which of the UK’s beauty spots are we flocking to?  Surrounded by 100 miles of countryside and historic towns, the Cotswolds has been crowned the most popular UK beauty spot, with more than 8.5 million prospective buyers viewing properties here in 2021. With travel links into London, Kent Downs and the Chilterns come in second and third place, and have mass appeal among part-time commuters.  Meanwhile properties in the beauty spot of Surrey Hills will cost home hunters the most, with the average home selling for £704,813.  Although the Scottish Highlands’ Kyle of Tongue missed out on the top 10, it might be worth considering if you’re on a budget. Zoopla named it the least expensive beauty spot, with homes selling for £118,302 on average.
