England’s Covid R rate has remained steady, according to the latest government figures. The UK Health Security Agency said on Friday the reproduction number is between 0.9 and 1.1 - the same as last week. If R is greater than 1 the epidemic is generally seen to be growing; if R is less than 1 the epidemic is shrinking.
