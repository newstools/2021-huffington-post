You are reading Anywhere But Here, our summer-long series on travel at home and abroad, serving up the information and inspiration you need. Summer may now be over, sob, but we’re not done with our holidays needs (we’ve been cheated of late!), so it’s only natural Brits are craving a bit of travel. And we’re not stuffing our suitcases back into the loft anytime soon. In fact, according to Tripadvisor’s newly published Autumn Travel Index, half of Brits are planning an autumn break this year. Boomers are the most likely to be heading off on holiday with 57% saying that they plan to do so – nice if you have the cash! – followed by 51% of millennials. Folks are still determined to make up for lost travel time due to the pandemic by packing in as many trips as they can. Over a third (35%) are planning two autumn trips and more than one in 10 (11%) are planning three or more. Even Gen Z travellers aren’t holding back, with a third (36%) saying they will take three or more trips.  With so much uncertainty surrounding Covid-19, staycations are still the trip of choice this autumn – 62% of Brits are planning to travel domestically, while only one in seven (14%) are planning on going abroad.
