The early 2000s were a wild, arguably tragic time for fashion: Some of the “greatest” hits of the era included embroidered low-rise jeans, Von Dutch hats, cowl-neck tops, dresses over jeans and Ugg boots in every colour of the rainbow.

Those long, stringy scarves everyone seemed to have bought in bulk! But words are getting in the way here. Instead of telling you, we’ll show you. Below, we present a visual ode to fall fashion that could only come from the early noughties.
