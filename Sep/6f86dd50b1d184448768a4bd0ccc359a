Jennifer Lawrence is pregnant with her first child. The Oscar-winner is set to welcome a baby with her New York City art dealer husband Cooke Maroney, a spokesperson has conformed. The couple were first linked in 2018 and became engaged in February the following year. They tied the knot in October 2019 with a ceremony at a mansion in Newport, Rhode Island. Celebrity guests were said to include Emma Stone, Kris Jenner and Amy Schumer. The 31-year-old Hunger Games star previously described her husband as “the greatest peron I’ve ever met”. Speaking on a 2019 podcast, Jennifer was asked why she married him and said: “I don’t know, I started with the basics: ‘How do I feel? Is he nice? Is he kind?’ “It’s just – this is the one, I know that sounds really stupid but he’s just, he’s the greatest person I’ve ever met, so I feel very honoured to become a Maroney.” The actor will next star alongside Leonardo DiCaprio in the Netflix film Don’t Look Up. The superstar duo will play astronomers who discover there is a comet heading directly towards earth. Don’t Look Up will be released in cinemas in December and on Netflix on December 24.
