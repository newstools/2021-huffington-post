Westminster insiders are bracing themselves for Boris Johnson to start a highly-anticipated cabinet reshuffle on Wednesday afternoon.   A No.10 source confirmed the prime minister would make changes to his top team today to “put in place a strong and united team to Build Back Better from the pandemic”. “Yesterday the prime minister set out his plan for managing Covid during the autumn and winter,” they said. “But the government must also redouble our efforts to deliver on the people’s priorities. “The PM will be appointing ministers this afternoon with a focus on uniting and levelling up the whole country.” Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, and Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, have both been subjected to persistent rumours they could face the chop. Both men were missing from the government front bench during PMQs at midday. HuffPost UK understands Williamson gave a leaving speech in his office early this afternoon. Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, is among those tipped for a promotion, as is Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove.
