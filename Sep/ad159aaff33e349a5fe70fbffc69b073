Cardi B announced the birth of her second child with husband Offset Monday in a sweet Instagram post showing the couple gazing at their new baby. She captioned the photo simply, “9/4/21” ― presumably confirming the newborn arrived on 4 September ― and included dinosaur, blue heart and teddy bear emojis. The WAP rapper and Migos member already have a daughter together, three-year-old Culture. Offset also has three older children from previous relationships. Cardi B publicly revealed her pregnancy during the 2021 BET Awards in June. During Migos’ Type S**t performance, she joined them onstage wearing a custom bodysuit with a mesh cutout showing her pregnancy bump. The next day, she thanked fans for their “congrats and well wishes” in an Instagram post featuring an affectionate photo of herself and Offset. “We listened to each other, communicated, prayed and then God blessed us and our family with another little blessing,” she wrote. “Our home feels so blissful and very busy... but we are ready and so happy!!”
