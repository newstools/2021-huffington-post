George, who has Down’s syndrome, is an actor, dancer and ambassador for the charity Mencap, a charity that works to improve the lives of people with learning difficulties. He has previously worked for the broadcaster, making a video for BBC Bitesize discussing five myths about Down’s syndrome. In a video announcing the news, George said: “When I was young I was told that I can be anything. “And look – here I am in the CBeebies House, ready to cook and sing. This is me, I am George. I can’t wait to be your friend.” People took to Twitter to react with delight to the news, withpeople describing George as a “superstar” and praising the BBC for “doing a wonderful thing”. Many shared photographs of themselves and their children already keenly-anticipating George’s first on-screen appearance. Actor Sally Phillips, whose son Olly has Down’s syndrome, was among many thrilled about the news. She tweeted: “Oh CBeebies I COULD NOT LOVE YOU MORE. This means so much to us and ISN’T GEORGE AMAZING!!”
