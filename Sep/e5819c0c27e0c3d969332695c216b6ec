Harry Styles proved this week that he’s not just good at singing, dancing, acting, hanging out with Stevie Nicks and wearing necklaces — he’s also got a talent for giving advice.  The 27-year-old pop superstar was performing a concert in St. Paul, Minnesota, on Wednesday night when he noticed a fan’s sign in the crowd that read, “Should I text him?”  HARRYS RESPONSE TO A FANS “SHOULD I TEXT HIM” SIGN THE WAY HE PACES AROUND IM LAUGHING pic.twitter.com/2wrEsOD4IJ Harry had quite a bit to say in response to the sign of the times. But, like any sound advice giver, he needed a bit more context. “I have a question: Is he nice to you?” the singer asked from the stage.  A friend of the sign holder yelled that this mystery man was not.   “In my opinion,” Harry proclaimed, “if you should, this isn’t even a question.” He went on, mimicking the thought patterns confused daters are all too familiar with: “If you’re wondering if we’re playing games; if you’re wondering, ‘should I text him? Should I not text him? ... Can’t text him too soon. And now I’m thinking about double-texting, that’s a whole risky business.’ ... It’s a whole thing.”  The Watermelon Sugar singer then concluded with a little help from “The Notebook”: “My personal opinion is that if there’s any sort of games, trash! Trash! Trash! Not for you!” The audience loved the response, as did fans on Twitter...
