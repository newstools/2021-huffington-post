The songs and dances this year’s Strictly Come Dancing celebrities will be cutting a rug to on the first live show of the series have been revealed.  Saturday’s episode will see the 15 new celebrities and their professional partners take to the floor for their first competitive performance.  As ever, the series is kicking off with a number of Cha Chas, while both Nina Wadia and Ugo Monye have been given the somewhat unenviable task of beginning their Strictly journey with the Samba, which is notoriously quite difficult.  Here’s the full list... The build up to the first live show has seen it embroiled in a vaccine controversy, after it was reported that three of the professional dancers have not been jabbed. Last week, The Sun claimed that two of Strictly’s team of 18 professional dancers had made the decision not to be vaccinated against Covid-19, with the tabloid later claiming that a third has also turned down the offer to get jabbed. This has apparently led to some feelings of “resentment” among members of the hit BBC show’s cast and crew. Even Boris Johnson weighed in on the matter this week, with the prime minister saying he “does not mind lecturing” Strictly’s pros in urging them to get a Covid jab. A spokesperson for the show told the PA news agency they could not comment on whether the BBC or the production team know the vaccination status of the professional dancers. The rep added: “We do not comment on speculation of somebody’s Covid vaccination status. “Strictly Come Dancing production has, and will continue, to follow strict Government guidelines to ensure the safety of all on the show.” Strictly Come Dancing airs on Saturday at 7pm on BBC One.
