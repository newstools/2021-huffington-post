Lady Gaga’s impressive array of face masks aside, last year’s COVID-impacted MTV Video Music Awards is best forgotten as just another underwhelming virtual awards show. But the ceremony returned to its former glory with an in-person event airing live from the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, on Sunday night, where revamped Moon Person trophies rained down upon some of the biggest names in music.  The 2021 ceremony hosted by Doja Cat, who took home the Best New Artist trophy last year, featured 14 gender-neutral categories across musical genres and a star-studded slate of performers. Heading into the night, Justin Bieber led the pack with seven nominations and ultimately took home prizes in major categories, including Artist of the Year and Best Pop. Newly anointed Grammy royalty Megan Thee Stallion trailed closely behind with six nods of her own, including four for her anthem WAP, but failed to gain much traction at the ceremony. Artists Cardi B, Billie Eilish, BTS, Drake, Lil Nas X, Doja Cat and Olivia Rodrigo each earned five noms apiece.  Rodrigo, who delivered a camera-shattering performance of Good 4 U early in the show, won multiple awards, including Best New Artist and Song of The Year for her chart-topping ballad Drivers License. But Lil Nas X managed to take home the night’s top award — Video of the Year — for his controversy-sparking Montero (Call Me By Your Name) music video, and he thanked the “gay agenda” in his acceptance speech.  The Foo Fighters, who scored three nominations this year, were also honoured with the first-ever U.S. Global Icon Award. Big-name acts Lorde and Nicki Minaj pulled out days before the show, but plenty of stars still performed at the ceremony, including Justin Bieber, Alicia Keys, Normani, Chlöe, Camila Cabello, Shawn Mendes, Ed Sheeran, Kacey Musgraves, Busta Rhymes and Twenty One Pilots. Lil Nas X also took the stage, making a name for himself in the VMA history books with a steamy recreation of his latest music video.  Billy Porter, Kourtney Kardashian, Ashanti, Megan Fox, Hailey Bieber, Avril Lavigne, Ciara, Ja Rule, Simone Biles, SZA and Lance Bass were among the famous faces who presented awards throughout the night.  Check out the complete list of nominees and winners below.  Cardi B ft.
