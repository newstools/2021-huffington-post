BBC Breakfast star Carol Kirkwood was left red-faced - but unscathed - during Monday morning’s show when she found herself dragged to the floor by a guide dog. During the live broadcast, Carol was presenting a segment remotely while holding the dog named Flash, praising her good behaviour to Dan Walker and Louise Nugent. Unfortunately for Carol, that was short-lived. A few moments later, the Labrador apparently tired of her TV appearance and made a bolt for it, taking Carol with her and leaving her face down on the ground. 🛑 @carolkirkwood down!Flash the guide dog is running the show on #BBCBreakfast this morning 🐾 https://t.co/g98lIxe3Fapic.twitter.com/6ym3obw6Tz “We’ve got a Kirkwood down!” Dan announced. “Someone save Carol!” After gathering herself and putting her earpiece back in, which had been knocked out during the tumble, Carol assured her co-hosts she was doing alright, adding: “She’s a very strong girl, Flash.” Fortunately, Carol saw the funny side of the gaffe, and quickly reposted it on her Twitter page later in the morning: However, regular BBC Breakfast viewers will know this isn’t the first time that Carol has found herself at the centre of a canine-related blunder. Last summer, she found herself tongue-tied while presenting live from Greenwich Park, where she highlighted just how many dog-walkers could be seen around her. Except… that’s not quite what the tongue-tied former Strictly Come Dancing star ended up saying. “We’ve seen lots of doggers,” she announced, before quickly correcting herself, adding: “Not doggers of course. Lots of dog walkers and joggers around here during the course of this morning.” BBC Breakfast airs every weekday from 6am on BBC One.
