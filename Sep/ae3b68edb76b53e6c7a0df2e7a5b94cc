On Friday, the UK government announced a major scaling back of travel restrictions, a move likely to prompt a surge in bookings for holidays abroad. Aside from a cheaper, simpler system of testing, central to the shake-up was to scrap the “traffic light” system that determine the testing and quarantine requirements to visit another country. From October 4, the “amber” and “green” lists will go, with only one “red” list remaining. Before then – specifically 4am on Wednesday – eight countries will come off the “red” list. They are Turkey, Pakistan, the Maldives, Egypt, Sri Lanka, Oman, Bangladesh and Kenya. People returning to the UK from “red” destinations will still be forced to enter a quarantine hotel for 10 days, which will cost solo travellers £2,285.
