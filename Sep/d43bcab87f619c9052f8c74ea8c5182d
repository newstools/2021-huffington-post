Netflix’s royal drama The Crown and feel-good Apple TV+ comedy Ted Lasso nearly swept the board at the 73rd Primetime Emmy Awards on Sunday night, cementing the dominance of streaming platforms at the show once and for all. Hosted by Cedric the Entertainer and broadcast live from Los Angeles on CBS and Paramount+, the ceremony was held in person with a limited and vaccinated audience after last year’s pandemic-impacted virtual award show. Given how television became a boon for viewers throughout the lockdowns and quarantines of the past year, it’s only fitting that binge-friendly streaming services were victorious at the award show, which has historically given top prizes to cable and broadcast networks.  Every drama series nominated eventually bowed to The Crown, which tied The Mandalorian (Disney+) with the most nods for any single show heading into the evening. But the Netflix series chronicling the reign of Queen Elizabeth II over various decades eventually took home the Outstanding Drama trophy, as well as honours in writing, directing and acting fields.  Despite this year’s crop of drama acting nominees standing as the most diverse in Emmys history, not a single performer of colour walked away with an award. Instead, The Crown snuffed out all competition with Josh O’Connor (Prince Charles) and the queen herself, Olivia Colman, triumphing in the Lead Actor and Lead Actress races. Meanwhile, Gillian Anderson and Tobias Menzies, who portrayed Margaret Thatcher and Prince Phillip in the series, respectively, also won trophies for Outstanding Supporting Actress and Actor.  With reigning comedy Schitt’s Creek out of the running at the ceremony, Ted Lasso swept major categories, including Outstanding Comedy, as well as dual wins in the Supporting Actor races for its stellar freshman season. Star and executive producer Jason Sudeikis also picked up multiple awards, marking his first-ever Emmy trophies.  The only comedy acting award that eluded the Ted Lasso crew went to Jean Smart, who scored the Lead Actress Emmy for her revelatory turn in Hacks. The HBO series also picked up wins in the comedy directing and writing fields. The tightest race, however, belonged to the limited series, which pit heavy hitters, including Mare of Easttown, Wandavision, I May Destroy You and The Underground Railroad against one another in far-too-crowded categories. Kate Winslet came out on top in the Lead Actress race, while Michaela Coel took home a trophy for writing her masterwork, dedicating her win to “every single survivor of sexual assualt” on stage.  But it was The Queen’s Gambit that pulled off the ultimate checkmate, picking up a directing prize and the night’s final award for Outstanding Limited Series.  Check out the complete list of winners and nominees below.   Outstanding Drama Series WINNER: “The Crown” “The Mandalorian” “Pose” “This Is Us”  “The Boys” “Bridgerton” “The Handmaid’s Tale” “Lovecraft Country”   Outstanding Comedy Series “Black-ish” “Cobra Kai” “Emily in Paris” “Hacks” “The Flight Attendant” “The Kominsky Method”  “PEN15” WINNER: “Ted Lasso”   Outstanding Limited Series “Mare of Easttown” WINNER: “The Queen’s Gambit”  “The Underground Railroad” “I May Destroy You” “WandaVision”   Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series Uzo Aduba, “In Treatment” WINNER: Olivia Colman, “The Crown”  Emma Corrin, “The Crown”  Elisabeth Moss, “The Handmaid’s Tale” Mj Rodriguez, “Pose” Jurnee Smollett, “Lovecraft Country”   Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series Sterling K.
