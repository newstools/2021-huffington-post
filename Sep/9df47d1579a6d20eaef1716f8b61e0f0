Donald Trump couldn’t beat Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election, but he claims he could beat the current president in a boxing match. The former president is scheduled to do commentary for a boxing match between 58-year-old Evander Holyfield and 44-year-old Vitor Belfort at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel in Hollywood, Florida, on Saturday. During a promotional event Thursday, Trump was asked if there was anyone he’d like to fight. Trump, who joined the event via a phone call, didn’t need to think much about whom he’d want to box. “Well, if I had to pick somebody in the world, not only a professional boxer because I’ll take a pass on the professional boxers,” Trump said. “I think probably my easiest fight would be Joe Biden because I think he’d go down very, very quickly. Very, very quickly.” The 75-year-old former president claimed the 78-year-old current president would “be in big trouble,” adding, “I think Biden would go down within the first few seconds”.

The online oddsmaker MyBookie put out theoretical odds on a Trump-Biden fight and made the current president an underdog. Although a literal fistfight between presidents would certainly be a big news story, it seems unlikely to happen ― especially on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. For one thing, Biden doesn’t appear to have the time to promote a match between two ageing boxers. CBS News reports Biden will be busy on Saturday visiting all three sites where planes crashed on September 11, 2001.
