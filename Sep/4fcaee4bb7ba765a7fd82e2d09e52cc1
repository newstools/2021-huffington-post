After Melissa McCarthy shared some advice she’d written to her future self on The Late Late Show Wednesday, she and her 9 Perfect Strangers co-star Nicole Kidman asked host James Corden to contribute his own. The British presenter and actor didn’t hesitate: Do as Cher would do, he said, because she has the “best advice.” “She’s got this great thing where she says, if you’re in a spin or really angry and stressed about something, ask yourself: ‘Does this matter in a year’s time?’ And if it doesn’t matter in a year, it doesn’t matter. And if you think it will matter in a year, then it matters,” he recounted. We’re happy that James has found tranquility through the Believe singer, but he might have got her advice slightly wrong. In a 2018 interview with talk show host Graham Norton, Cher spoke of a tip she received from her mother: “If it doesn’t matter in five years, it doesn’t matter.” Eh, what’s a few years’ difference? Watch the video below. (Fast-forward to the 5:52 mark for the Cher segment.)
