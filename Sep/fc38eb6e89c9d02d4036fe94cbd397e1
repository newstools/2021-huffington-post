A stray cat at the Miami football game fell from the upper deck and these guys saved it by catching it in an American flag. Dudes rock.  pic.twitter.com/9qgXkdiLFH The fur flew at a University of Miami football game on Saturday – and thankfully some fans caught it.  Viral videos of a cat dangling by its claws from the upper deck at Hard Rock Stadium revealed the happy ending – and a patriotic one at that. Some quick-thinking spectators stretched out an American flag to cushion the kitty’s fall after it plummeted from above.

The wire service reported that the cat was “not showing signs of any injury.” The cat landed safely, according to the stadium Twitter account. “We wish the cat the best in his remaining eight lives,” the stadium tweeted.  Miami defeated Appalachian State 25-23, but the best catch happened off the field, AP noted.
