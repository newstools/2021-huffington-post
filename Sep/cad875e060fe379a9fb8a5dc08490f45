James Bond’s most difficult mission yet? Sticking to a release date. As one of the first major feature films to be pushed back due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, No Time to Die, which will be Daniel Craig’s final outing in the franchise, has been tinkered with more than any gadget Q could whip up for the beloved super-spy.  But the 25th instalment in the 007 series is set to finally (optimistically?) hit cinemas at the end of this month, which means it’s time to ready ourselves for Craig’s swan song in the much-delayed film. The final trailer for No Time To Die was released on Tuesday, and begins with flashes of the actor’s most memorable moments during his time as the secret agent – although, shockingly, his emergence from the sea in tiny blue swim trunks was not included.    All of his trouble in the previous four films have led him to this: a face-off with a new villain, Safin, played by Bohemian Rhapsody star Rami Malek, who threatens his blossoming and uncharacteristically committed relationship with Lea Seydoux’s Madeleine Swann, who was first introduced in 2015’s Spectre.  Before long we see Bond do what Bond does best ― outwitting, out-brooding and outdoing his enemies in spectacular fashion. This time around, he has a little help from friends, including a fight-ready CIA agent (Ana de Armas) and a “new double 0” operative (Lashana Lynch).  Ahead of the film’s release, Being James Bond, a new documentary about Daniel Craig’s 15-year tenure playing the iconic character, will whet fan’s appetites. The 45-minute film takes viewers behind the scenes of each of the actor’s Bond films and explores his evolution as an action star.  “My world had turned upside down,” the British star says in the trailer for the new doc. “But I’m incredibly proud and incredibly fortunate to do this.”   No Time To Die is slated to hit UK cinemas on 30 September.
