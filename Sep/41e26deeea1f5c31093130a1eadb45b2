It will probably come as no great surprise to hear that Line Of Duty and Ant and Dec were among the winners at this year’s National Television Awards. Following the huge success of the BBC police drama’s sixth series earlier this year, Line Of Duty triumphed in the Returning Drama category, ahead of The Crown, Call The Midwife and Unforgotten. It also took home the Special Recognition prize for its impact in the past year. AdChoicesADVERTISING Meanwhile, Ant and Dec picked up their 20th consecutive win in the Best Presenter category, as well as a second award for their work on the most recent series of I’m A Celebrity (beating another of the duo’s shows, Saturday Night Takeaway, for the Bruce Forsyth Entertainment Award). Coronation Street picked up all three of the night’s soap-related categories, including Serial Drama performance for Mollie Gallagher and Newcomer for Jude Riordan.   New Drama was one of the tightest races of the night, with It’s A Sin taking home the award on the night, while the Great British Bake Off was the recipient of the Challenge Show prize.
