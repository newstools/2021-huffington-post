“Bennifer” is officially back! Jennifer Lopez on Saturday appeared to finally confirm her relationship with Ben Affleck, posting a photograph of them kissing on Instagram and Twitter. Jennifer, who turned 52 on Saturday, posted the steamy picture as part of a series of photos in which she donned a printed string bikini, marking her birthday. “5 2 … what it do,” she wrote in a caption with a heart emoji. Prior to the makeout pic, the couple — who dated and got engaged in the early aughts before calling it quits — had kept mum about their rekindled romance. The pair, who have been seen canoodling for months, made their first joint Instagram appearance on Friday in a snap posted by friend and actor Leah Remini. A source told Entertainment Tonight in June that the couple were feeling “hopeful about their relationship this time around“ and were ”on the same page.”
