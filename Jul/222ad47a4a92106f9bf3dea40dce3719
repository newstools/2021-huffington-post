It’s taken a while to warm up, but it feels like the Love Island we know and love is finally starting now that we’re a week into the series.  The latest episode saw us say goodbye to Chuggs after Rachel chose to couple up with Brad, while there were also unspoken tensions brewing between many of the pairings, especially Jake and Liberty and Aaron and Sharon. But it was actually the trailer for Tuesday night’s episode that got everyone the most excited, as two new arrivals look like they’re going to cause serious problems for the current couples, while a huge argument looks set to erupt.  While we wait to find out what on earth has happened to leave Hugo in tears, here’s our selection of the best memes from Monday night... Love Island continues on Tuesday at 9pm on ITV2 and ITV Hub.
