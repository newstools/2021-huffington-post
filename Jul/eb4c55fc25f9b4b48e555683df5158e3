Tom Daley has finally achieved his Olympic dream of winning a gold medal after he and his diving partner Matty Lee triumphed in the men’s synchronised 10-metre diving competition in Tokyo. The pair were overcome with emotion after they topped the leaderboard in the nail-biting final, beating China’s Yuan Cao and Alsen Chen in the event on Monday morning. The British pair’s total score of 471.81 left the Chinese pair with too much to do and when their tally of 470.58 appeared on the giant screen, Tom, Matty, their coaches and team-mates could not hide their emotions. Prior to the Tokyo Games, Tom said he wanted to continue diving until he won an Olympic gold. He can now add that to the bronze medals he won at the last two Olympics. He’s now the first British diver ever to win three Olympic medals. It is Matty Lee’s first Olympic games and he has won gold. Tom and Matty weren’t the only ones overcome with emotion at their win. Tom’s husband, Dustin Lance Black tweeted that there were “so so many tears”. Many others, including plenty of famous names, were quick to congratulate the pair on their victory... It was a great start to the week for Team GB. As well as Tom and Matty’s gold, Adam Peaty also won gold in the 100-metre breaststroke and Tom Piddock’s victory in the men’s cross country mountain biking brought Team GB’s gold medal total to three.
