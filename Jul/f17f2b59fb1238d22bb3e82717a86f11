Presenting your child with a collection of shiny new stationery is one of the best parts of prepping for a new school year. It can really help to get kids excited about heading into the classroom after a summer of fun in the sun.  When looking for ‘back to school’ supplies, we like to divide our shopping list into two sections: the first is uniform and sensible shoes, which we often end up buying at the last minute. Dragging our heels? Who, us? Never Sir, honest. Then there’s the second section. Oh, how we love that second section, because it contains all the fun bits like pencil cases, schoolbags, notebooks and stickers, which are just as much of a joy to browse for parents as for their kids. Whether your child needs their own stationery at school or these goodies get used at the kitchen table for their homework, there are plenty of stand-out items designed by a whole range of independent artists available at Redbubble. We’ve trawled through the site to bring you 20 of the best buys for inspiring young minds.
