Oh, it’s great being British, isn’t it? We moan for months on end about the rain and wind and grey skies and how we wish summer would get a hurry on. Then someone mentions the word ‘heatwave’, we all bulk buy sunscreen and barbecue food, only for the hot weather to arrive – and we can’t deal. As temperatures soared this weekend, the nation did what it does best: took off all its clothes, acquired some dodgy tan lines, started getting just a little too warm now, actually – then tweeted the world about it. (And the world said: “call this a heatwave!?”)
