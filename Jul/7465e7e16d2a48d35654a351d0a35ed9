Love Island welcomed two new faces on Thursday night, as new bombshells Chuggs and Liam strutted into the villa.  With bonds starting to develop and a recoupling looming, there’s bound to be drama in store over the next few episodes, as we’re likely to see at least one boy dumped from the Island.  But in the meantime, there were plenty of great memes as the newbies got settled in – here’s some of our favourites from Thursday night... Love Island continues on Friday at 9pm on ITV2 and ITV Hub.
