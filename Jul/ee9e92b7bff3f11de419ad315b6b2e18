England’s Covid R rate has remained unchanged at between 1.2 and 1.4, scientists advising the government have said. Because the figure is over 1, it still means the epidemic is growing in England. If R is greater than 1 the epidemic is generally seen to be growing; if R is less than 1 the epidemic is shrinking. If R is at 1, the epidemic is staying at the same size. In England, the R rate is between 1.2 and 1.4 ( unchanged) East of England – 1.3 to 1.5 (up from 1.2 to 1.5) London – 1.2 to 1.4 (unchanged) Midlands –1.2 to 1.4 (down from 1.3 to 1.5) North-east and Yorkshire – 1.2 to 1.5 (down from 1.2 to 1.6) North-west – 1.0 to 1.2 (down from 1.0 to 1.3) South-east – 1.2 to 1.5 (down from 1.3 to 1.6) South west –  1.3 to 1.5 (up from 1.2 to 1.5) The estimates are provided by the UK Health Security Agency. Sage and DHSC have previously said “particular care should be taken” when interpreting the regional estimates in England.
