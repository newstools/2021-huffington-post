Peter Kay has announced he is returning to the stage for two special charity shows. The comedian has been largely absent from the public eye since cancelling his 100-date stand-up tour in December 2017, but will host two live Q&As next month. The shows at Manchester’s O2 Apollo are to help raise funds for 20-year-old Laura Nuttall who has an aggressive type of brain cancer called glioblastoma multiforme. The news was announced on Peter’s Twitter account, alongside a link to a fundraising page for Ms Nuttall, entitled Doing It For Laura. The 48-year-old star has been largely out of the limelight since December 2017, when his tour was cancelled due to “unforeseen family circumstances”. He made a surprise appearance at a charity screening of his series Car Share in 2018. In January, he appeared on BBC Radio 2 to chat to Cat Deeley about his love of music, mixtapes and the musical Mamma Mia. During his interview with the former SM:TV Live presenter, Peter shared a hilarious story about the time he went to see the Mamma Mia! stage show in London’s West End.  Peter’s shows will take place at the O2 Apollo Manchester on August 7 and tickets go on sale on July 30 at 9am.
