A Dundee primary school class has been crowned the UK’s funniest with a topical joke about face masks. Class 5B from Forthill Primary School entered the Beano’s annual competition to find Britain’s Funniest Class, and came out on top with their timely submission joke winning 21.7% of the public vote. And the gag goes as follows. AdChoicesADVERTISING “What did the face mask say to the mouth?” “Let me cover for you!” Boom, tish.  The joke was one of 10 shortlisted by a panel at the DC Thomson comic before the public decided which they found funniest. Beano’s Mike Stirling presented the class at Forthill with the official trophy, alongside a bundle of goodies including Beano subscriptions for all the children. “We’ve learned our greatest gags have always come from kids themselves and Britain’s Funniest Class has schooled us yet again, raising some much-needed chuckles in classrooms,” he said. 1.
