Bridgerton has paused filming on its second season after two people on set tested positive for Covid-19 in the span of a few days.  The hit Netflix period drama initially halted production for 24 hours on Thursday after a crew member tested positive, Deadline reported on Saturday. Production then resumed on Friday, but was paused again on Saturday due to a second person contracting COVID-19. A spokesperson for Netflix did not say whether the second person who contracted the virus was a cast or crew member and declined to provide additional details to HuffPost. Bridgerton is the first scripted Netflix show to come out of the multi-year deal struck between the streaming service and Shonda Rhimes’ production company, Shondaland. The period drama – which Netflix has said is its “biggest series ever” – racked up 12 Emmy nominations earlier this week. Shondaland and Netflix announced in May that the Bridgerton universe was expanding with an upcoming limited series prequel about a young Queen Charlotte.  The series is set and filmed in the United Kingdom. Cases of Covid-19 in England have risen to one in 95 — the highest prevalence since February —according to a Friday report by Britain’s Office for National Statistics.
