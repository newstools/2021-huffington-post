Gary Lineker has been named as the BBC’s highest paid star for a fourth year in a row, despite last year agreeing to a pay reduction of around £400,000. The corporation has just published its annual report for 2020/21, which revealed the salaries of presenters who earned above £150,000.  The Match Of The Day host took home between £1,360,000 and £1,364,999, having reduced his salary from £1.75m from the year before.  Radio 2’s breakfast host Zoe Ball remains the broadcaster’s second highest paid talent asking to reduce her pay by 28% to £980,000 to reflect the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. This figure is lower than is listed in the 2020/21 annual report, which shows her earnings to be in the bracket of £1,130,000-£1,134,999 and which represents only a few months of Zoe’s new salary deal – including the reduction the presenter requested. Not all stars’ earnings are published as the list does not include those who work on programmes produced by BBC Studios, which is classed as a commercial entity. For example, the stars of shows such as EastEnders and Strictly Come Dancing do not have their earnings included in the list. Similarly, Graham Norton – who dropped out of the top 10 earners after leaving Radio 2 in December – does not have his salary from his chat show included as it is made by independent production company So Television and distributed by BBC Studios.  (figures taken from BBC News) 1.

BBC director general Tim Davie said: “The BBC has delivered outstanding content and value to audiences in extraordinary circumstances this year. I am proud of all we have achieved to inform, educate and entertain the Nation in record numbers during the pandemic. “The BBC is responding to global competition and pressure on our finances. But, we know we must do much more to ensure licence fee payers across the UK get best value from the BBC, to maintain their trust and provide a service they cannot do without. “I am absolutely focused on making the reforms we need to ensure the BBC is positioned to offer all audiences the best possible service well into the future.” CORRECTION: A previous version of this story stated that The Graham Norton Show was produced by BBC Studios.
