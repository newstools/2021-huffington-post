Mila Kunis was not over the moon with her husband’s plan to fly to space. In an interview published earlier this week, Ashton Kutcher told website Cheddar News that he’d bought a ticket for billionaire Richard Branson’s next Virgin Galactic flight and was all set to rocket into space — until his wife talked him out of it, that is. “When I got married and had kids, my wife basically encouraged that it was not a smart family decision to be heading into space when we have young children,” Ashton explained. “So I ended up selling my ticket back to Virgin Galactic.” Asthon became the 500th person to buy a Virgin Galactic space flight ticket back in March 2012, three years before he and miLA got married. Richard Branson – who owns the space travel company – and five of his employees hurtled into space from New Mexico on Sunday. The 70-year-old is the first person to blast off in his own spaceship, beating fellow billionaire Jeff Bezos and his company Blue Origin by nine days, the Associated Press reported. Branson and the other passengers reached an altitude of about 53 miles over the New Mexico desert, allowing them to see the curvature of Earth and experience a few minutes of weightlessness before heading back down.  Virgin Galactic plans to do one more test flight before it begins flying paying customers, CNN reported. The company already has more than 600 potential space tourists with reservations, per AP. Tickets initially cost $250,000 (around £182,000) each, but when the company reopens ticket sales soon, they’ll be even pricier. “I was supposed to be on the next flight, but I will not be on the next flight,” Ashton told Cheddar. Although Mika shut down her husband’s current dream (perhaps because she saw this bit on Late Night with Seth Meyers), he is still not giving up. “At some point, I’m going to space,” he insisted.
