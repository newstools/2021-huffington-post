Meghan Markle is to executive produce a new animated programme for Netflix, her production company has announced. A post on Archewell Productions’ website said the series, titled Pearl, would tell the story of the adventures of a 12-year-old girl inspired by influential women from history. It is the second show from the Netflix deal the Duke and Duchess of Sussex signed last year following Heart Of Invictus, a previously-announced docuseries about the Invictus Games. Meghan said of the forthcoming show: “Like many girls her age, our heroine Pearl is on a journey of self-discovery as she tries to overcome life’s daily challenges.” She continued: “I’m thrilled that Archewell Productions, partnered with the powerhouse platform of Netflix, and these incredible producers, will together bring you this new animated series, which celebrates extraordinary women throughout history.” Filmmaker David Furnish, who is the husband of Sir Elton John, will also work on the programme. Meghan added: “David Furnish and I have been eager to bring this special series to light, and I am delighted we are able to announce it today.” The former Suits actor and her husband Prince Harry signed a major deal with Netflix last year, said to be worth millions of pounds, to make films and television series. At the time, the streaming giant said the pair would create “content that informs but also gives hope”. Archewell replaced Harry and Meghan’s Sussex Royal brand after they quit royal duties. The name was inspired by their son Archie – combining “arche”, the Greek word meaning source of action, and “well” as “a plentiful source or supply; a place we go to dig deep”.
