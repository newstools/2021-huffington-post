It seems Love Island’s Sharon Gaffka is having a change of heart about her feelings for Hugo Hammond. Fans of the ITV2 reality show saw the pair form a friendship couple during the latest recoupling on Monday night.  However, Sharon might be starting to catch feelings for the PE teacher after her romance with Aaron Francis cooled off last week.  In scenes to air during Tuesday’s show, Sharon tells Kaz Kamwi: “Sharing a bed this time around is very different. “I do think he is fit but is it that I just think he’s fit and nothing else?” Kaz tells Sharon that she thinks that there is more between them than just a physical attraction as they seem to get on very well. Kaz says: “It’s not that you just think he’s fit because you guys actually get along. You like him as a person.” Sharon replies: “I think I did rule it out in the beginning but I think seeing qualities that were missing in Aaron and seeing them in Hugo has made me really think things through. He’s a really good communicator and we talk about everything and anything.” Kaz then tries to find out if Hugo is having similar thoughts, asking him: “Do you have this with Shaz, right? You get along as friends and you don’t know if it’s just pure friendship or more, or not really? You guys were coupled up on the first day?” Sharon and Hugo initially formed a couple at the start of the series when they failed to be picked by the other Islanders, before she and Aaron went on to explore their connection.  Last week, Sharon and Hugo clashed when he suggested he found “fake girls” a turn off, prompting a row about cosmetic surgery.  Elsewhere in Tuesday’s episode, Liam Reardon and Millie Court head to the Hideaway, and there’s a dramatic message for the Islanders as they are warned about a double dumping... Love Island continues on Tuesday at 9pm on ITV2 and ITV Hub.
