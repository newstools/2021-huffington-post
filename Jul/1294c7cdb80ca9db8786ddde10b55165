Jonathan Ross made his Celebrity Gogglebox debut on Friday night and viewers had so many questions about a certain piece of furniture in the chat show host’s front room: mainly “where can I get one?” Jonathan settled down on the family sofa with his son Harvey Kirby, daughter Honey Kinney and Honey’s boyfriend, musician Zane Saz to give their opinions on the week’s telly. Well we say sofa, we’re not entirely sure that does it justice... Size of it. Twitter had serious sofa envy... Jonathan admitted he had been a big fan of Gogglebox before appearing on it and tweeted beforehand. “We’ve always loved the show @C4Gogglebox and tonight (some of) the family are on it! #CelebrityGogglebox at 9pm,” he wrote. Celebrity Gogglebox airs Fridays at 9pm on Channel 4.
