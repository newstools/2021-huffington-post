Gareth Southgate has led the England team through a history making Euro 2020 tournament – and given the nation a much needed mood boost and some important life lessons along the way. Who needs Instagram inspiration or corporate training days when we’ve got the man from Crawley motivating us all. Here, for those times when you really need the pep, are our all-time favourite Southgate quotes. “My job is to allow people to dream. Make the impossible seem possible.” “More expectation is a healthy thing and something we have to embrace.” “My players’ feeling is the most important thing for me.” “Write your own stories.”  “It’s impossible to please everybody all of the time, but you just have to believe that you’re making decisions for the right reasons.” “If you keep always doing what you’ve always done, you get the same results.” “I’m no David Beckham.”  “The questions around us principally come down to character; the essential ability to withstand events that go against you.” “I am confident that young kids of today will grow up baffled by old attitudes and ways of thinking.” “We always have to believe in what is possible in life and not be hindered by history or expectations.” “You remember where you were watching England games. And who you were watching with. And who you were at the time.” “Our country has been through difficult experiences in terms of unity. Sport – football in particular – has the power to help that. It is a special feeling.”  “We’ve all had an incredible experience. For me, that’s what sport should be about. You give everything you have.”
