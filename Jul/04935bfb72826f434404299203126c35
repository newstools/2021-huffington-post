Love Island has only been back on our screens for three days, but already we’ve said a premature goodbye to one Islander, and we’re about to welcome two more.  Show bosses have released more details about two new bombshells, whose arrival was trailed at the end of Wednesday night’s show.  Following Shannon Singh’s exit, the contestants will soon be joined by new boys Chuggs and Liam, as they seek to shake up the villa.  Get to know them better below...  Age: 23 From: Surrey Job: Business owner – customised hats He says: “My mates would describe me as a solid mate.

I do seasons in Ibiza, every day you’re meeting someone new. I was a host of a beach club.
