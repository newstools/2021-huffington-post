England’s Covid R rate has fallen slightly to between 1.2 and 1.4, scientists advising the government have said. Last week it was estimated to be between 1.2 and 1.5. Because the figure is over 1, it still means the epidemic is growing in England. If R is greater than 1 the epidemic is generally seen to be growing; if R is less than 1 the epidemic is shrinking. If R is at 1, the epidemic is staying at the same size. In England, the R rate is between 1.2 and 1.4 ( down from 1.2 to 1.5) East of England – 1.2 to 1.5 (up from 1.1 to 1.5) London – 1.2 to 1.4 (up from 1.1 to 1.4) Midlands – 1.3 to 1.5 (up from 1.2 and 1.5) North-east and Yorkshire – 1.2 to 1.6 (down from 1.3 to 1.6) North-west – 1.0 to 1.3 (up from 1.1 to 1.2) South-east – 1.3 to 1.6 (unchanged) South west –  1.2 to 1.5 (up from 1.3 to 1.6) The estimates are provided by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) and the Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC). Sage and DHSC said “particular care should be taken” when interpreting the regional estimates in England.
