England’s Covid R rate has fallen slightly to between 1.1 and 1.3, scientists advising the government have said. Last week it was estimated to be between 1.2 and 1.4. Because the figure is over 1, it still means the epidemic is growing in England. If R is greater than 1 the epidemic is generally seen to be growing; if R is less than 1 the epidemic is shrinking. If R is at 1, the epidemic is staying at the same size. An R of between 1.1 and 1.3 means every ten people with Covid will infect between 11 and 13 other people. In England, the R rate is between 1.1 and 1.3 ( down from 1.2 to 1.4) East of England – 1.0 to 1.2 (down from 1.1 to 1.3) London – 1.0 to 1.2 (down from 1.1 to 1.3) Midlands – 1.0 to 1.3 (down from 1.2 to 1.4) North-east and Yorkshire – 1.2 to 1.4 (down from 1.2 to 1.5) North-west – 1.0 to 1.2 (down from 1.1 to 1.4) South-east – 1.1 to 1.3 (unchanged) South west –  1.3 to 1.6 (down from 1.3 to 1.7) The estimates are provided by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) and the Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC). Sage and DHSC said “particular care should be taken” when interpreting the regional estimates in England.
