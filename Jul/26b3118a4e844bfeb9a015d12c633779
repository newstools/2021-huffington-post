Gillian Anderson has declared that she’s now freeing herself from the cumbersome, red-mark-inducing confinement of bras. The star of The Crown opened up about allowing her breasts to breathe during a Q&A with fans on Instagram Live earlier this week. “I’m so lazy. And I don’t wear a bra anymore. I can’t wear a bra.

I’m not wearing a bra anymore. It’s just too fucking uncomfortable,” she said.  As for her clothing of choice, Gillian said she would wear “comfortable” black trackies and a black hoodie “every day” if she could. “[It’s] probably the same as my go-to out-of-lockdown outfit,” the actor added. “I’m so lazy.” And although many fans on Twitter celebrated Gillian’s aversion to underwire, some complained that they’d never have that luxury.
