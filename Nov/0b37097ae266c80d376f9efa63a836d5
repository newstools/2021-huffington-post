We hope you love the products we recommend! All of them were independently selected by our editors. Just so you know, HuffPost UK may collect a share of sales or other compensation from the links on this page if you decide to shop from them. Oh, and FYI — prices are accurate and items in stock as of time of publication. It’s been a bumper Black Friday season this year, with deals first launching in early November and they just keep on coming – from Amazon smart devices to Wayfair homeware, top beauty brands and grooming bargains, heavily discounted baby products, gorgeous kitchen essentials and much, much more. We’ve even rounded up the most boring but brilliant deals for you to bag, on everything from cat food to car wash and razor refills.  But what isn’t at all boring is decent money off high ticket tech items, and so we wanted to bring to your attention to a very appealing deal we’ve just spotted: 17% off Apple Airpods and Charging Case that you can find right now on Amazon. If that doesn’t sound much, it adds up to a tidy £20 quid off, which is a rarity on a premium Apple product. It’s only applicable while stocks last, and we hear they are selling fast. So don’t miss out: snap ’em up here now.
