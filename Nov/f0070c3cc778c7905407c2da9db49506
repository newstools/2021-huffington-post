This year’s ad, titled ‘Unexpected Guest’, follows 14-year-old Nathan and space traveller Skye, who crash lands in the woods near his home.  Not only is the advert as heart-warming as we’ve come to expect, it’s packed full of some of the retailer’s best festive products.  From the Christmas jumper that Nathan gifts Skye to the stars on the tree, there’s a wide selection of seasonal products to choose from.  Want to recreate the magic in your home? We’ve got you covered.
