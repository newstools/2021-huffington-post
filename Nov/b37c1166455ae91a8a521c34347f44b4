Black Friday is a big, big day in Amazon land, with thousands of brands discounting their products up to and beyond 50% off on November 26. This year, we’ve already seen a slew of early Black Friday deals launched on the site through November with big name brands from beauty to homeware. Of course, Black Friday is also a great time to snap up Amazon’s own-brand tech – from Kindles to Fire Sticks to Echo Dots – often at greatly reduced prices. And, shhh, don’t tell too many people, but plenty of those device deals have landed early. Here, we round up the best for you here while stocks last.
