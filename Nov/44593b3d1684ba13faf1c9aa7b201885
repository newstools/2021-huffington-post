Frankie Bridge was left in tears during Thursday’s I’m A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! after a conversation about rice with music producer Naughty Boy. Tensions were beginning to rise in the camp after the contestants, who had been split into two groups, were reunited in Gwrych Castle, Abergele, in North Wales. Naughty Boy, who had been staying in The Clink and made to act as a servant for the other camp, was close to leaving the show before the reunion. While in the main camp, the musician expressed concerns over the way the rice was being cooked when former Saturdays singer Frankie Bridge said: “You’re just coming into our camp and this was just what we did…” Everyone is talking about 'Ricegate' 🍚 #ImACeleb https://t.co/cyUSx1eg7Y Naughty Boy interrupted: “No, this is our camp. That’s wrong what you just said…. It’s not your camp. ”Don’t say things like you came to ‘our’ camp.” Confiding in Radio 1 Extra DJ Snoochie after the conversation, Loose Women star Frankie said: “I’d rather not have rice at this point. I just hate any confrontation. Now I’m like, ‘Oh my god, did I say something bad?’ “Now I’ve offended him … why am I talking about rice. I’m someone who avoids confrontation at all costs. I just hate it. I don’t understand what the issue is.”  In the Bush Telegraph, Naughty Boy added: “Frankie said something that implied we were in different camps … We are in the same clothes now. You don’t get anywhere without voicing what you feel. Shall we just say this is like a teething period?”  Soap star Danny Miller said: “The lack of food and the lack of sleep is taking its toll a little bit … I don’t think there was any malice in it and I think it was mistaken by Naughty Boy.” Making their debut into the castle were soap stars Adam Woodyatt and Simon Gregson, who took part in the trial Castle Scare Fair to win food for their new campmates. After a round where the actors had to manoeuvre sheep’s testicles from one tray to another using only their mouths, presenter Ant McPartlin said: “You can tell they’re from the soaps as they give you drama!” Having completed the trial, the two new campmates discovered they would be sharing a bed. Simon revealed he farted “like a trooper” before Adam joked “can we have single beds please?” TV presenter Richard Madeley was forced to withdraw from the show after breaking the “Covid bubble” during a hospital trip, which was not shown in Thursday’s episode. I’m A Celebrity…Get Me Out Of Here continues on Friday at 9pm on ITV and ITV Hub.
