But when it comes to self-care, there’s a common misconception it’s only about a daily routine, when actually it’s good to think seasonally. You might not realise it but the changing of the seasons has an impact on both your mind and body, with studies showing that shifts in the amount of daylight we get and the temperature inside and out or homes, have a much more significant impact on us than we might realise.  This means that when a new season arrives, such as winter, it can help to make some tweaks to your routine. As the colder weather lands, these simple self-care treats will help you to brave the chill and keep your wellbeing in check.
