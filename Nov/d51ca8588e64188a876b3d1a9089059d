Miriam Margolyes proved to be the gift that keeps on giving as her latest travel series with Alan Cumming debuted on Tuesday night.  True to form, the show was full of laughs as the pair headed up to Scotland in a campervan to return to their family roots. But there was one particular moment that could not have been any more Miriam Margolyes.  We are, of course, talking about the moment she went to “take a shit” (her words) and threatened to pull a camera off the bathroom wall.  The scene saw Alan discussing putting a recently acquired toilet seat cover in their shared loo, but Miriam was less keen, for practical reasons. The legend that is Miriam Margoyles #MiriamandAlan https://t.co/6ZcB2pNmQ4 pic.twitter.com/9WNzHckjO2 “I think it’s much better as a bag and I want to have a shit. I’m so sorry. Could I have my shit first?” she asked.  As she then headed to the bathroom, she soon encountered another problem. “Why doesn’t the door shut?” she said, as she manoeuvred herself into the cramped loo.  As Alan pointed out there was a camera in there, Miriam bellowed: “Oh for fuck’s sake! Get the fucking thing off, before I pull it off.” While we can’t say whether or not the camera did end up being taken down, luckily we were spared having to watch the subsequent scenes.  Earlier this week, Miriam had an explosive outburst of a different kind as she appeared on This Morning. She made a special appearance on the ITV daytime show to offer advice to viewers going through an array of issues. However, during her introduction, it seemed co-host Phillip Schofield was having some difficulty getting his words out, for reasons that soon became clear. You'll never believe why Miriam has Phillip and Holly in stitches 🤣 pic.twitter.com/NbtshihSe2 Miriam And Alan: Lost In Scotland continues on Tuesday at 9.15pm on Channel 4.
