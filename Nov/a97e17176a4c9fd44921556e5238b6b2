MPs voted 250 to 232 to approve an amendment to consider reforming the House of Commons standards system – and prevent the immediate suspension of Conservative former minister Owen Paterson. In an unprecedented move, MPs voted not to back the cross-party Standards Committee’s call for a six-week ban from parliament for Paterson after it found he repeatedly lobbied ministers and officials for two companies paying him more than £100,000 per year. MPs backed an amendment calling for a review of his case after Conservatives were ordered to support the bid and Boris Johnson questioned whether the investigation into Paterson was fair. Paterson said the move would allow him to clear his name after “two years of hell”, but anti-corruption campaigners, unions, political observers and Opposition MPs condemned the decision, with the Tories accused of “wallowing in sleaze”. According to the the PA news agency, the division list contains 248 names on the ayes and 231 names on the noes – which could be caused by votes not being registered correctly or a miscount by tellers, and the list may be updated later. 246 Conservative MPs: Nigel Adams (Selby and Ainsty), Bim Afolami (Hitchin and Harpenden), Adam Afriyie (Windsor), Lucy Allan (Telford), Lee Anderson
