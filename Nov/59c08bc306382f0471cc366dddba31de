With five couples left in the competition, Strictly Come Dancing bosses have announced the songs and dances for this year’s quarter-final. After landing at the top of the leaderboard last week, it’s been revealed that John Whaite and Johannes Radebe will be dancing the Salsa to We Are Family by Sister Sledge. Having survived the most recent-dance off, CBBC presenter Rhys Stephenson will be hoping to avoid the bottom two with what promises to be a dramatic Argentine Tango to Phil Collins’ In The Air Tonight. We can also look forward to a Tango from Dan Walker, while AJ Odudu will be aiming for that elusive 40 for her Salsa routine. Five couples, five fabulous routines.

Her dance-off performance was particularly noteworthy as her professional partner Nikita Kuzmin suffered a wardrobe malfunction and ended up finishing the routine completely shirtless. Strictly Come Dancing returns on Saturday night at 6.40pm.
