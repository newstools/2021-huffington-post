Warning: Major spoilers ahead. Has there ever been a closer Great British Bake Off final? Judges Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith certainly didn’t think so. It was also one of the most stressful finales in Bake Off history. But in between Crystelle’s raw focaccia, Giuseppe’s cold oven and Chigs’ unrecognisable Belgian buns, there were, as ever, plenty of laughs and joy to be found... Please support my friends baking in THE FINAL OF GBBO 2021 @giuseppecooks Chigs and Crystelle. Don't forget the tissues #GBBOFinal #GBBO pic.twitter.com/SLP3jApSC0 Noel harassing the bakers like: #GBBO #GBBOFinal pic.twitter.com/woDqYi5SVz What in the Sigourney Weaver is around Dame Prudence Leith’s neck?! 👀😂 - #GBBO  #GBBOFinal pic.twitter.com/LtqA7Ona3W Ok no #gbbo spoilers I promise but I'm obsessed with these names. Is Chanel the oldest? The youngest? Why did she not get an extra -le? pic.twitter.com/etdRsN8Cpg You can actually pinpoint the second when her heart rips in half...#GBBO #GBBOFinal pic.twitter.com/FEJdw2F1WY I adored lovely #Jurgen #GBBO & think he should have been in #GBBOFinal but I'm so glad gorgeous #Guiseppe  won. He reminds me so much of #DonaldSutherland circa late 1970s #AnimalHouse They could be twins! https://t.co/P41yfdttjc pic.twitter.com/oyXl7Scnah Paul leaving the Technical instructions #GBBO #GBBOFinal pic.twitter.com/WoC7Rvar6U Ooh, that looks sore... #GBBOFinal pic.twitter.com/2OHHNtzRX4 Relatable. #GBBOFinal pic.twitter.com/kYKEiZs1dv Truly historic 'hands-on-the-face' Giuseppe despair for the final. #GBBO pic.twitter.com/J16yqq2dMq Me watching Guiseppe make stupid mistakes #GBBOFinal pic.twitter.com/4PIiqJifwk NOOO IT’S ALL GOING WRONG FOR GUISEPPE I CAN’T WATCH #GBBO #GBBOFinal #BakeOff pic.twitter.com/8L7AZvBKK7 This is such a heartwarming moment.Congratulations, Giuseppe! 🎉#GBBOFinal pic.twitter.com/qZUfK6fZnd Italians if they win the Eurovision, Euros, and bake off all in one year #gbbo pic.twitter.com/bSO88m07Eu we need giuseppe to finish the trinity of ‘italians beating the british at things’ #GBBOFinal #gbbo pic.twitter.com/HQwA4aJCxY The Italians have done it again #GBBO #GBBOFinal pic.twitter.com/LN3NfxkUDa What was the secret to Giuseppe winning Bake Off?Great determination, great skills, great perseverance… and MR SPATULA! 😂😂 #GBBOFinal pic.twitter.com/L5iE21qknW “This is Mr Spatula. You just have to kiss his head and then you win.” - @noelfielding11 #GBBOFinal pic.twitter.com/IUcWis07Sz What a Brexit analogy, Giuseppe wins #GBBO and immediately leaves the country. Brexit as #GBBOWon by an Italian who was living in GB, he took the prize and moved to Italy Ok, so we all ship Chigs and Crystelle, right? #GBBO pic.twitter.com/R5mCZTGmDj What if we get rid of Paul and Prue and replace them with Jürgen and Giuseppe? #GBBO pic.twitter.com/ZC8OV5AZNd Cool. Now give us the series where Jurgen and Giuseppe drive around Europe in a camper van solving baking related crimes. #GBBO This is a really lovely picture and one that demonstrates true friendship, magnimity & kindness. #GBBO https://t.co/ESnJBxo9zi If you're having a bad day, or you're losing faith in humanity, just watch the reaction of the two non-winners.Immediate and absolute joy and support for their friend, even though he beat them.🥰#GBBO https://t.co/O2wJhb8c0Q Take a bow, Giuseppe. Such wonderful words. We wish you and your family the very, very best. ❤️❤️ #GBBOFinal pic.twitter.com/aSUEm2uUue I could have never gone through this exhilarating, but also draining adventure without the support of my wife, my fellow bakers and the constant support of the production team!Thank you all out there, for reaching out and showering me with love!
