A BBC host may have overshared a bit on Wednesday while discussing homemade jewellery on air. Tom Hepworth of South Today made his shocking revelation after colleague Alexis Green said she had once made earrings for family and friends. “I once made a necklace out of teeth for a girlfriend,” Hepworth declared. “Oh, that’s lovely,” Green replied. “For a girlfriend?” “Yeah, it didn’t last long,” Hepworth said. Teeth pic.twitter.com/nrDiCsS1bq Hepworth made things hilariously worse when he tried to explain on Twitter. “Probably should’ve mentioned: They were mine, we were both consenting goths at the time and it was acceptable back then,” he wrote. He included a few good puns, too: #tomscrownaffair and #fangsforthemories. Probably should’ve mentioned:They were mine, we were both consenting goths at the time and it was acceptable back then #tomscrownaffair #fangsforthememories https://t.co/hgkeu5bJIR People on Twitter made some biting remarks. Amateur! Ears are what make the best necklaces. everyone knows that. Ten quid there is a body in his garden Bloody hell. Umm was it your baby teeth that you forgot to exchange for cold hard cash with the tooth fairy? Or did you go to the dentist and say whip these out I’m making a necklace? She was overjoyed pic.twitter.com/abLqFrU04s There’s probably an entire jewellery store of this nature. My bet’s on Transylvania. Reminds me of my favourite exchange with my son:Me: are you OK?Son: Why?Me: It's just that there's blood on your school shirtSon: Oh. That's OK. It's not my blood. And yet 'girlfriend' was the word she chose to query in that statement 🤔 Fangs are not what they used to be?
