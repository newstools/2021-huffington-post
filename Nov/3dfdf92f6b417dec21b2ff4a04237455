Boris Johnson left the audience completely bemused after he started hailing Peppa Pig World during a speech on Monday. Speaking at a conference for the Confederation of Business Industry (CBI) the prime minister not only lost his place, imitated the “brmm brmm” of a car, but referred to his recent trip to the family theme park. He said: ”Hands up anybody who has been to Peppa Pig World? “Not enough. I was a bit hazy [about] what I would find at Peppa Pig World but I loved it. Peppa Pig World is very much my kind of place. ″It has very safe streets, discipline in schools, heavy emphasis on new mass-transit systems I noticed, even if they’re a bit stereotypical about Daddy Pig. ″The real lesson for me, going to Peppa Pig World – I’m surprised you haven’t been there – was about the power of UK creativity.  “Who would have believed that a pig that looks like a hairdryer, or possibly a Picasso like hairdryer, a pig that was rejected by the BBC would now be exported to 180 countries with theme parks both in America and China as well as in the New Forest.” He added that he thought the cartoon was “pure genius”, claiming no civil servant would “conceivably come up with Peppa”.

I thought the speech went over well.” A Peppa Pig World spokesperson did later add: “We were delighted the prime minister devoted so much of his speech to us.” Unfortunately, not many people seemed to agree on Twitter. Lol, he's crap at speeches, thinks he's Moses and is chatting about Peppa Pig, but actually what he's doing to day is a detailed robbing of the poorer off to protect the richest. Its full of niggly details and difficult maths but the fact remains. He's laughing at us MacmillanWe have not overthrown the divine right of kings for the divine right of expertsChurchillFailure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that countsJohnson [fumbling through pages]Has anyone here been to Peppa Pig World? Boris Johnson arriving at "Peppa Pig World" 😃 pic.twitter.com/puPdQ5WODJ Every time I switch on the TV expecting to hear the outcry at the Prime Minister having lied to the electorate about his social care plan all I hear is people talking about Peppa pig. I’m sure this wasn’t intentional.. Boris Johnson should’ve stayed in Peppa Pig World.His bizarre performance and speech at the CBI conference will alarm business leaders, Tory MPs and voters.Nurse! Moses parted the Red Sea, @BorisJohnson just stayed at a friend's villa there! Suspect the CBI would have learnt considerably more from Peppa Pig. https://t.co/s132MoQrE6 Announce Peppa Pig govt PPE contract https://t.co/PF7GIgYBjp Ladies and gentlemen, the love child of Kermit the Frog and Peppa Pig: https://t.co/B4Z6BJSZ3p I think the intent of the Peppa Pig routine was to nick the headlines without allowing Keir Starmer's appearance a look in. But messing up his notes (who doesn't number pages in a speech?) has cost him dearly. People are openly questioning his abilities now. ‘Levelling Up’. Why, are they building a ‘Peppa Pig World’ there? https://t.co/x15OEyBMHF What is it with Tory PMs and pigs A national embarrassment, as well as a corrupt coward.pic.twitter.com/eSv19QJdKf When it's all fucked up and your advisors give you the go ahead to talk Peppa Pig pic.twitter.com/fq8MX2E2ZB “Peppa Pig world is my kind of place”First of all, I wonder why?  🙄Second of all, I hate Peppa Pig like most of us do, but I kinda feel sorry for the girl after this https://t.co/9N2Mfp8pFn
