There’s not a lot that could upstage Adele, but Dame Emma Thompson’s dancing came close during the singer’s TV special on Sunday night. The actor was one of many famous names who attended the recording of ITV’s An Audience With Adele, and she really got into the spirit of things by busting out some killer moves throughout the show. Although the British singer is famed for her powerful ballads, Emma was up on her feet every time Adele sang anything remotely uptempo during the show at the London Palladium. Dame Emma Thompson is living her best life and I am here for it! 💃💃💃@Adele #AnAudienceWithAdeleWatch An Audience with Adele RN on ITV and ITV Hub - https://t.co/2ZZI2RS0mI pic.twitter.com/3q8mug2Nif In one clip, the actor can be seen living her best life as she dances between comedian Michael McIntyre and her husband and fellow actor Greg Wise. Viewers were very much here for it... OH MY GOD EMMA THOMPSON #AnAudienceWithAdele pic.twitter.com/uMC2Tq5jAv I'm not a betting man but I think Rolling In The Deep is Emma Thompson's favourite Adele song. pic.twitter.com/MHUrwhPJ1E dame emma thompson is a whole ass mood pic.twitter.com/9BFXWZvCWS Petition for Emma Thompson to be in the audience for all performances forever more🤣 The way she just had to unleash those moves for Rolling In The Deep 😅 #AnAudienceWithAdele pic.twitter.com/kJxXHeF7vX When Dame Emma Thompson instructs you to start dancing, you dance pic.twitter.com/4pvuJjVTKE Sorry but Emma Thompson is a whole vibe 💃🏾 #AnAudienceWithAdele pic.twitter.com/LahdoxyjkN I’m loving how low key chaotic the British Adele special is compared to the US one. Who needs a Hollywood sunset when you can have Alan Carr filling in while her make up gets touched up following an emotional ambush via a drunk Emma Thompson. Everyone knows (& needs!) an Emma Thompson at family functions. Generally, it’s me. Love her. #Adele30 #AnAudienceWithAdele #AnAudienceWithAdeleThem: You can't dance to an Adele songEmma Thompson:pic.twitter.com/O2l3NBQdYX Emma Thompson is all of us after a few bottles of wine pic.twitter.com/aG7BAxSQVp emma thompson’s new role as a hype woman for adele pic.twitter.com/bydTaGCjkJ Here's every time Emma Thompson danced tonight.You're welcome. #AnAudienceWithAdele pic.twitter.com/qJP45dbdxi Dame Emma also had a one-to-one moment with the singer during the concert where she first asked her if she was wearing socks under her elegant black gown, to which Adele confirmed she was actually wearing tights but they were falling down. The actor then asked: “When you were younger, was there someone who supported you or inspired you or protected you from all the trials and tribulations of life and inspired you to go on?” The singer replied that her English teacher at her school Chestnut Grove in Balham. Dame Emma then surprised Adele by inviting Ms McDonald on stage and the pair embraced with the singer becoming instantly emotional. We all have that one teacher who changed our life… such a beautiful reunion! ❤️*PS, would totally buy Alan Carr’s version of ‘Make You Feel My Love* 🤣@Adele #AnAudienceWithAdele https://t.co/2ZZI2RS0mI pic.twitter.com/hlTOOZKt5j Idris Elba, Years And Years star Olly Alexander, Dua Lipa, Boy George, Stormzy and Emma Watson were also among the famous faces in the audience.
