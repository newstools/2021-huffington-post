Aldi couldn’t resist poking fun at their recent caterpillar cake drama in their new Christmas advert. Earlier this year, Aldi found themselves at the centre of a legal row with Marks & Spencer, after the latter claimed the former’s Cuthbert The Caterpillar cake infringed on their own iconic Colin The Caterpillar trademark. Following reports of M&S having taken legal action, Aldi repeatedly poked fun at the matter on social media, and latter gave their own caterpillar cake a makeover in the wake of the lawsuit. After Aldi debuted their new Christmas ad earlier this week, viewers spotted a reference to the debacle in the background of one scene. While the A Christmas Carol-inspired clip centres around a Scrooge-like fruit named Ebanana – who is visited by Aldi’s regular character Kevin the Carrot – the opening shot of the clip shows a sad-looking caterpillar cake being led off in handcuffs. And the subtle dig definitely got the thumbs up from viewers on social media: High praise for the Aldi creator genius who had Cuthbert Caterpillar being nicked by the police at the start of the Christmas advert #AldiAmazingChristmas pic.twitter.com/59qxgS82U5 .@AldiUK have won the Christmas ads, again 👍🏻Particularly like Cuthbert the caterpillar being arrested by the sour lemons at the start 🤣#AldiAmazingChristmas #KevinTheCarrot #MarcusRadishford https://t.co/a7TkEI4aM8 Someone pointed out that there’s a caterpillar getting arrested in the background of the Aldi Christmas ad - a great dig at M&S 🤣 @WHS_Carpet https://t.co/TDE6CUxLTp So far #Aldi is the front runner for best #Christmas ad, look closing at cuthbert the caterpillar being arrested 😆 🤣 https://t.co/UWJhnBbCsS Cuthbert the Caterpillar being arrested by some lemons...

M&S unveiled their own Christmas advert last week, which saw them bringing their much-loved Percy Pig character to life for the first time – and roping in a certain Hollywood heartthrob to provide his voice. Meanwhile, Disney and McDonald’s are among the big-name brands to have gone down a more tear-jerking route for their festive ads in 2021, with John Lewis also living up to their reputation for giving us all of the feels with their latest Christmas campaign.
