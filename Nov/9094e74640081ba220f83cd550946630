As cohabiting couples will tell you, working from home together has its upsides and its downsides.  Sure, it’s fun to have an impromptu mid-morning coffee date at the kitchen table or eavesdrop on their tense phone calls with colleagues. What’s not so fun is when your partner’s obnoxiously loud typing makes it impossible for you to concentrate. Or when you make a surprise half-naked cameo during your significant other’s Zoom meeting after being assured their camera was off.  Below, we’ve rounded up 29 comical tweets about sharing a home and an office with your partner.
